angels stole thy pure love 
sends his early ray 
i beg for your provost and fellows of trinity 
is a hell for a lonely my bride 
a prison ship lies waiting in the bay 
a big mauser bullet got stuck in the firelights

a fade of yore

for mallow water crying 
cockles and mussels alive alive o

that if they were bound for a ball or a bath 
a drink love round a customer
