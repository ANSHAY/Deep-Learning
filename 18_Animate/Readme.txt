Project: Animate
Description: In summary, it is a project that captures photos of real animals from a mobile device and classifies them into their respective classes viz. cat, dog, cow, etc. It is a sub-project of a bigger project that utilizes this classification to capture photos of real animals and transform them into virtual monsters inside a game such that players can use their devices to capture monsters from the real world.
This part of the project uses deeplearning to classify the images into animal classes eg. dog, cat, fish, etc.
