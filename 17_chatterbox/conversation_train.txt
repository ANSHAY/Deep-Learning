Fine.
I've enjoyed conversing with you.
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
I've got to go.
I wasn't done talking to you.

I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.

You don't need to worry about that.
That was mean to say.

What's the weather going to be like?
I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
I believe so.
Good
I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
I know
I really want to go to the beach.
But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.
You're right
One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
I really wish the weather would just stay the same.
I do too
That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
A trip to the beach would be fun
How is the weather going to be?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
It sounds like it will be.
I really hope it doesn't get cold.
That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.
The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.
That is true
The weather is constantly changing.
It would be nice if the weather would never change.
That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
True
Predictable weather would make life easier.
It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
What's the weather going to be like
I may want to go too.
The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
Will it be good beach weather?
I think it will be.
It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.
This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.
I know
Every day the weather seems different.
I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
That would make it easier for us to make plans.
I know
Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
It's such a nice day.
Yes, it is.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
Why is that?
I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too
It always smells so fresh after it rains.
Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
Really
Why is it?
Because you can see the stars perfectly.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.
Isn't it a nice day?
It really is.
It seems that it may rain today.
Hopefully it will.
How come?
I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
I feel the same way
It smells so good after it rains.
I especially love the night air when it rains.
Really
Why?
The stars look so much closer after it rains.
I really want it to rain today.
Yeah, so do I.
Don't you think it's nice out?
Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain.
I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain?
The sky looks so clean after it rains
I love it.
I understand
Rain does make it smell cleaner.
I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come?
You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today.
I would too.
It's an ugly day today.
I know
I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day
Me too
I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
Me too.
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right
I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining
It's too hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel.
I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true
I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great
I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.
Hello, I need to register for a class.
What class are you trying to take?
I want to take a Psychology class.
Well, there are only two classes open.
Can you tell me what days the classes are on?
One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 p.m
- 4:00 p.m.
And the other class?
That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday.
Are you sure these are the only open classes?
Yes, I am sure.
Okay, sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday.
Very well then.
I would like to register for a class today.
No problem, what class would you like to take?
I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.
There are two classes that are still open.
Which days are these classes on?
The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three.
What about the other class?
The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10:00 a.m
to 12:00 p.m.
Are you sure there are no more open classes?
I'm positive.
Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.
Okay, I'll sign you up.
Could you help me to register for a class?
Do you know what class you want to take?
Are there any Psych classes available?
I believe there are still two Psychology classes open.
On what days are the classes?
There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4.
Can you tell me about the other class?
It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday.
You're positive that these are the only classes left?
These two are the only ones.
The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine.
Very good.
Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?
First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?
I was there too long.
Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
Yeah, I saw it.
You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
Yeah, I understand.
Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.
Yeah, you're right.
Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
OK, I will.
Good luck!
Man, I got another parking ticket
I am so unlucky--what can I do?
Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?
I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.
Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?
I could tell what I was supposed to do.
That's too bad
That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help you out
I guess not.
Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.
Sure, if it will help.
Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
Sounds good!
Give it your best shot; it might work.
I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.
Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you weren't supposed to be?
Both.
Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?
I was confused.
Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?
If it might work, I'll go for it!
Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it again.
I can see how that might work.
Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!
I could do that!
Try it
It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.
Can you tell me where I can park
Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?
I drive an automobile.
Fine
You can either park in the student lot or on the street
Do you know what a handicapped space is?
Yes, I have seen those spots.
Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park there unless you have a special permit
Are you going to be parking in the daytime or evening?
I park in the evenings.
Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs
Have you seen those signs?
Yes, I have seen those signs.
The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days
Do you know how to read the curb colors?
Yes, I know what the curb colors mean.
Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know.
Where should I park?
Do you have a car or motorbike?
I drive a scooter
In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street
Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots?
No, I haven't seen those spots.
The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit
Will you mostly be parking during the day or night?
I park in the daytime
Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits
Have you noticed those signs?
No, I have not seen the signs.
Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there
Do you know what the curb colors mean?
No, I don't know what the curb colors mean.
Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only
I think you'll be good to go!
What is the best place to park?
What vehicle do you usually bring to school
Is it an automobile or a motorbike?
I drive a motorcycle.
OK
That means you can park in the student lot or on the street
Have you seen the handicapped spots?
I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.
Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces
Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening?
I park days and evenings.
Be careful about the time limits on the streets
Have you seen the signs for time limits?
What signs?
As long as you are careful reading the signs, you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there
Are you aware of the curb colors?
What curb colors?
If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload, you are going to be OK.
I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester.
Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?
I am a daytime student.
Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?
I will be driving my car.
OK, that will be twenty-five dollars
How would you like to pay for it?
I'll pay for it with a check.
Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
No, thanks; I'm fine.
Here you go then
Have a great school year!
I'll need a parking permit for next semester.
Do you attend school during the day or only at night?
I only attend class part-time in the evenings.
Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile
I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school.
Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?
I'll pay cash.
Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?
No, thank you.
OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester.
I want to buy a parking permit, please.
Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?
I attend both day and evening classes.
Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?
I ride a motorcycle.
That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?
I'll use a credit card, thank you.
Do you need a second permit for a car?
No, just the motorcycle permit.
Fine, here it is and have a great semester!
Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?
Sure, it was confusing for me also
Have you ever used a regular meter?
Yes, I understood the old one.
Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?
Debit or credit card.
OK
Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?
Yes.
OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.
Yes, I can do that.
Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.
Yes, I'm ready.
All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.
Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?
It's simple, once you do it a few times
Do you know how the old one worked?
I never used a parking meter before.
So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit card.
Cash.
Fine, can you read the rate on the display?
Yes, I can.
Fine
Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.
I'd rather not pay, but I have to.
Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move on, all right?
Perfect, let's do it.
Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.
This parking meter is really confusing
Can you help me figure it out?
It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.
Yeah, OK.
The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is it?
I have coins.
Perfect
Now, can you see the rate on the sign?
I didn't see that, but now I do.
Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.
Here it goes!
You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.
I am a little confused.
Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!
Can you help me with returning my late books?
This is the right spot to pay your fee
Put your books down right here.
OK, here they are.
I can see that you owe 25 cents a day
That will be one dollar and fifty cents total.
OK, here's the money.
We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine
Does that make sense?
I'm not sure.
Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding fine.
Now I understand.
Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we are closed
Enjoy the library!
These books should have been turned in last week.
You have come to the correct place
Hand me your books.
Here they are.
Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.
I don't have the money right now.
We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester
So you will be okay to go.
What would happen if I didn't pay it?
It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card and transcripts on time.
Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that.
Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you returning your books for all to use.
My library books are late, where can I put them?
This is where they need to be turned in
Let me see them to check the date, OK?
Yeah, I think that they are really late!
Not all that late
You only owe the library fifty cents.
What if I can't pay it?
We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before the end of the semester.
Yeah, I get it.
Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so always make sure that you do that.
That's not really fair!
If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside
Thanks for coming in!
Excuse me
I am interested in getting a library card.
Sure, let me give you an application
You can fill it out right here at the counter.
OK, here it is.
Let me take a look at this for you
May I have your driver's license, please?
Here's my license and form
You seem to have filled the form out all right
Are you familiar with our rules and fines?
Yes, I know what to do.
The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.
OK, I see.
Thank you for joining the library; we look forward to serving you.
I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card.
Of course, just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished.
I'm finished.
I will also need your driver's license; hand me the filled-out form, please.
OK, the form is all filled out.
Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
No, I have no idea what they are.
Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
Yes, right.
Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.
Good morning
Is this where I can get a library card issued to me?
No problem, we have a short form right here; just hand it to me when you are done.
I'm done.
That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I.D.
Sure, here it all is.
Well, this looks nice
Do you know how to use it?
I am pretty sure how to use it, but can you remind me?
Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
I see.
Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!
Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?
Yes, I would be happy to help
What do you want to buy?
I want to buy that candy.
OK
So this machine will make change if you need it
Do you have your dollars ready?
Yeah, so far, so good.
Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot
Make sure they are smooth.
Yeah, I already knew that.
I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it.
OK, let's move on!
Now you just make your selection and pray
If nothing comes out, try again or call the number on the side of the machine.
I hope it works!
Well, good luck!
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help.
Sure, no problem
What are you trying to get?
I want to buy a drink.
OK
This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change
I've got the correct change already.
First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot
The dollars have to be smooth.
OK, what next?
Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.
OK, next
Choose what you want and push the button
Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.
I agree with you.
Hope that works for you!
I want to know how to buy something from this machine.
Yeah, the new ones can be tricky
What are you trying to buy?
I want to buy one of those snack things.
Are you ready to go?
I'm clear so far.
The money goes in the slot over there
It has to be smooth to go in.
It won't go in!
Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.
Yes, next step.
Make your selection and hope for the best
Vending machines aren't all that reliable.
They're totally unreliable.
You seem to have it down
Have a good day!
Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?
Sure! What kind of food would you like?
I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe.
I know the perfect place!
Good! Where is it?
It's right past that last building on the left
Do you want me to go with you?
That would be great.
Glad you asked me to join you
This will be fun!
Man, I'm hungry
Do you know a good place to have lunch?
Yes, I know a great place
What types of food do you like?
Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great.
Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat.
Is it close by?
It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?
OK, I'd love the company.
This will work out well
I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?
I'm hungry, too
What types of food sound good?
Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something.
I have a great idea of where you might like to go.
Can we walk there?
It's on the second floor
May I join you?
Of course! Let's go.
Let's hurry
I'm starving!
When are we leaving for our field trip?

Do you have any more questions?
Not at the moment—maybe later, though.
All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway
See you on Monday!
I am unsure how to add a class and need help.
I have an opening
Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?
Yes, I have an add sheet.
After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class
Do you know where that is?
No, I'm not sure.
When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you
Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line.
Thanks
I understand what to do now.
It should be easy to find
After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.
That sounds good.
Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class
Good luck!
Professor, can you help me add your class?
You have to bring me an add sheet to sign
Do you have one?
No, I will have to get an add sheet.
You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class
Do you know where that is?
No, I don't know where that is.
The office is in front of you as you cross the quad
The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.
I think I can find it.
You'll find it easily
Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.
Thank you for letting me add your class.
To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip
Good luck!
I am not sure how to add a class.
Do you have an add sheet for me to sign
I'll bring one next time.
When you get the signed add slip, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added
Can you find the office?
I think I know where it is.
Across the courtyard on the right is the office
Follow the signs to the correct line
Is that clear?
Thank you for your directions
It's clear.
You can't miss it
Add the class and then come back
We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet.
That's great
Thank you so much.
Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class
Good luck!
I have an appointment for 1:30.
What can I help you with?
Well, I have a problem with my class schedule.
What is it?
It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.
I can understand the problem with that.
Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?
No problem, do you want those classes still?
Yes, I do.
Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.
Thank you very much
I'm here for my appointment.
What can I do for you today?
I have an issue with my schedule.
Tell me the problem.
I have two classes on here that are at the same time.
Oh, I see.
Can you change that for me?
Do you still want both classes?
Yes, I would like to keep both classes.
I'll try to change one to a different day.
I would greatly appreciate that.
I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30.
Yes, I see
What did you need to see me about?
There's a problem with my schedule.
What's the problem?
Two of my classes occur at the same time.
Well, I can see that's a problem.
Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?
Yes, I can
Would you still like to have both of these classes?
I want to keep both of them, if that's possible.
Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day.
Thanks a lot.
Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today.
What is the problem?
I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative.
Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?
Yes, I've got that part covered.
When, exactly do you need to leave?
I don't need to leave until the very end of class.
Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again.
Thanks, Professor
See you later!
See you later! Drive carefully.
Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early.
Why do you have to leave early?
I am not feeling well.
Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?
Yes, it's all taken care of.
Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?
I can stay a few more minutes.
OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.
Thanks, Professor
I've got it covered!
Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.
I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class.
Where do you need to be that is more important than school?
I have an appointment.
Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?
No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.
Are you going to go right away?
I am leaving right now.
All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.
Thanks, Professor
I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.
Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school.
Excuse me, Professor
I am going to miss next week's class.
Is this something that you could schedule for another time?
No, I have to do this; it's important!
Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?
I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.
You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?
Yes, I know.
Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.
OK, I can do that.
Well, have a good day off from class.
Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting.
Is this absolutely necessary?
I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class.
Will you be able to make up the work you missed?
I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.
Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.
Yes, I remember.
Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?
Sure, no problem.
Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!
I'd like to talk to you about my grades.
Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?
I am worried that I messed up on a test.
Well, let me take a look at my grade book
How do YOU think you are doing?
I think I am doing great, except for that one test!
Well, your scores show that you could do a little better
What do you think you could improve on?
I think that I could study a little harder for tests.
Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.
Yes, I know.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?
Step into my office for a moment
What is your concern?
Am I failing?
Let's go on the computer to see what's up
Do you think you are doing well?
I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.
I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?
I missed a few classes; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis.
Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?
I'll try; it's hard!
Thanks for stopping by!
Professor, I'm concerned about my grades
Do you have a minute?
Of course, how can I help you?
I want to know if I am doing OK.
Let's pull out your scores so far
Do you think you are doing OK?
I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.
I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others.
I think I could take better notes and read a little more.
You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.
I'm working on it!
Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades.
Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and final.
What counts the most?
Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.
Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?
Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each.
What if we miss something?
I will allow one unexcused absence; after that you need to contact me ahead of time.
Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?
You will be able to track your progress during the year.
What do you base our grades on?
All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester.
Does the final count the most?
All of it is important; please just do your best at all times.
How do you total our scores?
The final and mid-term are twenty percent each; homework, attendance, and quizzes are the rest.
What if we are out sick?
Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on.
How do you decide what grade we get?
I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests.
What is the most important factor?
Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do your best from the beginning.
How can we keep track of our grades?
The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade; homework, attendance, and quizzes total 60 percent.
What if we can't get to school?
You can only miss one class without penalty.
If we have a major problem, will you let us know?
I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.
Do you have the notes from last week's class?
Did you come late?
I couldn't make it.
Why is that?
I was sick.
Oh, okay
Well, here you go.
Are these all of them?
Oh, wait, here are the rest.
Thanks a bunch.
Don't mention it.
Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?
Were you here last week?
I was unable to make it.
How come?
I was sick that day, and couldn't make it.
Well, here are the notes.
Are there any more?
Sorry, here you go.
Thanks a lot.
No problem.
Let me get last week's notes.
Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?
I couldn't come.
Why not?
I wasn't feeling well.
Here they are.
Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?
Oh, no, this is the rest.
Thank you very much.
It's no problem at all.
Excuse me, Professor
I think there might be an error in my test score.
Sure
Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right?
I think that the percentage is incorrect.
Let's just go over all of it to double-check.
Sure, let's do it.
Here is the answer sheet
Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?
I don't see any mistakes.
OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.
Yes, let's total it.
Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total
Do you agree?
Yes, you're right.
Well then, we are all straight
Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention.
I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.
Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?
I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.
These things can happen; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all right?
That would be great!
Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers
Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?
This one right here should be right.
Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?
Yeah, let's do the math.
I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total
Does this look right to you?
Looks pretty good.
Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!
Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong.
What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?
Both.
I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too
Will that work for you?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake.
These look strange.
Yes, I agree; let's move on to the calculating of the score
Would that be OK?
OK, let's do the calculation.
We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
I see.
Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!
Excuse me, Professor
I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done.
What happened that you didn't get it done?
I had to watch a football game instead.
Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?
Yes, I think so.
Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester
When will you be turning the make-up in?
I'll make it up next week.
Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an “A” in the class.
OK, I can do that.
Remember that you are in college now, not high school.
I don't have my homework today.
You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?
I was really sick.
But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?
Yes, I probably could.
You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?
Next class meeting.
That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, all right?
That would work for me.
Good
I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.
Let me tell you what happened to my homework.
OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?
Actually, I did it, but then it got lost.
Could you have gotten it done at another time?
Yes, I could.
You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?
I'll make it up early next week.
That would work, but don't let it happen again.
I'll try.
That will solve it then
Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
Professor, could I make an appointment with you?
I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four; do you have a particular time in mind
Two o'clock would be the best time.
Fine, do you know where my office is?
No, I'm not sure.
Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor.
I see.
Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there
I'll see you then.
I'll see you then.
Looking forward to meeting with you!
Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you?
I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four; what time works out best?
I would like to come in at three o'clock.
I am glad that that works out; can you find my office?
Yes, I can.
Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor.
I got it.
If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way.
Thank you, I'll be there.
If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!
Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you?
I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday; what works best for you
Three would be a good time.
Great, do you need directions to my office?
I'm not sure.
Well, just make sure to go through the double doors, and I'll be on the right.
OK, I'll find it.
It's very easy to find.
See you then.
I will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!
Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr
Miller?
Yes
Are you going to be taking a class from him?
Yes, but I have never taken his class before.
He is very interesting and challenging
Is that what you are looking for?
Yes, that's what I need.
He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade
Are you willing to study hard?
Yes, I guess so.
What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher
Do you enjoy that in a teacher?
Yes, I had a teacher like that before.
Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?
No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing.
Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you
Good luck!
Do you know anything about Dr
Miller's classes?
Yes
Are you in his class?
I'm thinking of taking his class next semester.
He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard
Would that be OK?
Yes, I really need someone who is really good.
I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it
Can you do that?
Maybe, but I'm not sure.
Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching
I like that, don't you?
No, that stuff isn't important to me.
Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?
I don't care about any of that.
We all are looking for different things in an instructor
I hope I've helped you.
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr
Miller's classes?
Yes
Have you ever been in one of his classes?
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.
He was a very easy teacher
Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades.
Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too?
I really need to learn this stuff.
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, that sounds right for me.
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?
Yeah, I already knew that
That could be a good thing.
I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you
Enjoy your year!
How do I buy my textbooks?
Do you have your book list for your class?
Yes, I have my list.
Fine
Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore
Do you know where that is?
Yes, I know where the bookstore is.
OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left
Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there
No, I didn't know I could do that.
You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door
Do you think you will be doing that today?
Yes, I am going today.
Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or tomorrow to help you
Would that work for you?
Yes, thank you
That would be great.
Well, then, I'll talk to you later
Have a good day!
Where can I buy textbooks?
First, you need to have the list of books for your class
Do you have that?
Yes, I have that.
Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore
Can you find it?
No, I don't know where the bookstore is.
Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left
Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
Really
How can I do that?
Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance
He will pay you for them
Are you going today?
No, I can't make it today.
I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or tomorrow
Would you like my help?
No, thanks
I'm good.
I'll see you later then
Have a great day!
Can you help me buy my textbooks?
There will probably be a book list in the bookstore
Do you have your class schedule handy?
No, I don't have that.
To get started, take that list over to the bookstore
Do you know where the bookstore is?
I am not sure where the bookstore is.
When you pass the gym, it'll be the first door on the left
Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money?
Yes, I knew I could do that
Exactly how do I go about selling them?
If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, he will reimburse you
Can you go over there today?
I think maybe I could be there.
I am free at 1:00 today or tomorrow if you need some help
Want to meet me over there?
Maybe that would work.
I'll catch you later then
Have a wonderful morning.
Could you help me?
What do you need?
I can't seem to find my class.
What building is it in?
It's in the C building.
Oh, I know exactly where that is.
Do you think you can tell me where it is?
Sure, what room number is it?
It's room number 261.
I have a class around there right now.
Could you show me where it is?
No problem, come on.
Excuse me, I need your assistance.
Sure, what's up?
I have no idea where my class is.
Tell me which building it's in.
My class is in the C building.
I know where the C building is.
Do you mind telling me where it is?
Of course, which room number is it?
Number 261.
I actually have a class right around there.
Can you please show me?
I can do that.
Do you mind helping me?
What can I help you with?
I'm not sure how to find my next class.
Do you know what building that it's in?
The C building, I think.
Well, that's not far away.
Could you point me in that direction?
Do you know what the room number is?
It's C261.
My next class is around there.
Can you show it to me?
Sure, let's go.
Hello, how are you doing?
Pretty good, and you?
I'm doing great.
That's great to hear.
So how long have you been going to PCC?
I've been going here for a couple years now
You?
This is my first year.
How do you like it so far?
It's all right.
You don't like it?
I'll like it better once I finish my GE.
That's exactly how I used to feel.
How are things with you?
Not too bad
How about yourself?
Not bad.
I'm glad to hear that.
Have you been going to PCC long?
I've only been here two years
How about yourself?
I just started this year.
Do you like it?
It's fine for right now.
You do not like it, right?
Once I'm finished with my GE, it should get better.
I felt the same way my first year.
How is everything going with you
Great
You?
Pretty good.
Good for you.
When did you start going to PCC?
This is my second year
How about you?
I only got here this year.
You like it so far?
It's OK.
I can tell you don't really like it.
It'll get better after I finish my General Education.
I understand what you mean.
How may I help you today?

It appears these books are two weeks late.
I forgot they were due.

How much is the late fee?
The late fee is 25 cents a day.
So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late?
It's 25 cents for each book.
That's a lot of money.
What can I do for you?
I'm returning these books.
Let me have them.
Here are all of them.
These books are two weeks late.
I didn't have time to return them.
You're going to have to pay late fees.

25 cents a day?
That means 25 cents for each late book.
That's expensive.
May I help you with something?
I would like to return some books.
I'll take them.
Here you go.
These books were due two weeks ago.
Yeah
I totally forgot they were due.
You will need to pay late fees on these books.
How much are the late fees?
The fee is 25 cents every day.
I have to pay 25 cents a day?
And that's for each book that is late.
That shouldn't be a problem
How may I help you?
I need to return these books
What happened to this one?
The cover came off.
You're going to need to pay for the damage.

Here you go.
Thank you very much.

Here's the five dollars.

I know it's not.
Here's the money for the book.
Thank you for your payment.
You are very welcome
What can I do for you today?

Why not?
It's just a policy of ours.
So what am I allowed to check out?
You may check out books or videos.
I need to check out this magazine.
You will have to just read it in the library.
That doesn't make any sense.
How may I help you?
I want to return this video.
Is that all you need?
I also need to check this magazine out.
You're not allowed to do that.
I don't understand.
It's our policy.

What can I do for you?
I am trying to find this book.
What's the problem?
It doesn't seem like this library has it.
Have you checked the computer?
I have already.
What did it say?
It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there.
I can always borrow the book from another library.
You can do that?
I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in.
That's fantastic
Thank you.
May I help you?
I would like to find this book.
Is there a problem?
I don't think you guys have it.
You should look it up on our computer.
I did that.
What came up?
It should be on the shelf, but I didn't see it.
I can try to get the book from a different library.
I didn't know you could do that.
I will call you when I find it.
I appreciate your help.
Do you need help with something?
I'm looking for this book.
Is there something wrong?
I don't see it on the shelf.
Did you check the computer?
I already looked.
Did it say anything?
It said that the book is on the shelf, but it isn't.
I'm sure I can get it from another library.
Could you do that?
I'll let you know when I get the book in.
That's great
Thank you so much
How may I help you?
I need to check these books out.
Do you have your library card?
Here it is.
It appears that you have late fees.
Really?
Yes, really.
How much do I owe?
You owe $24.50 in late fees.
I don't have that much today.
I'm sorry, but until you pay it, you won't be able to check out any more books.
I'll pay it as soon as possible.
What can I do for you?
I want to check out these books.
I need your library card.
I have it right here.
It seems you have late fees.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
How much?
Your late fees come to $24.50.
I don't have that right now.
You have to pay it off before you can check out more books.
I'll do that soon.
May I help you?
I would like to check out these books.
May I see your library card, please?
Yes
Here you go.
Apparently, you have unpaid late fees.
I do?
You owe some money.
Exactly how much do I owe?
You owe $24.50.
I won't be able to pay that right now.
Until you pay it, you can't check out books.
I will pay it
Don't worry
How may I help you?
I couldn't find the book I was looking for.
Have you checked the database?
I checked.
Was it on the shelf?
It should have been, but it wasn't.
Maybe someone took it.
Will you be getting another copy anytime soon?
I'm sure we will.
Would you be able to reserve it for me?
I sure will.
Thank you very much.
May I help you?
I can't find the book I want.
Why don't you try looking at the database?
I checked it already.
Do we have it available?
It wasn't there.
I guess it is lost.
Will you be getting another copy?
Yes, we will.
Could you reserve a copy for me?
I can do that.
That's great
Thanks a lot.
What can I do for you?
I was looking for a book, but I couldn't find it.
Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf?
I already did.
Is it on the shelf?
I didn't see it.
Apparently somebody took that book out of the library.
Will you ever get another copy?
We will definitely be getting another.
Could you please reserve it for me?
That won't be a problem.
Thanks
I really appreciate that.
How are you doing today?
Good
Thanks for asking.
What may I do for you?
I need help with something.
What do you need help with?
I am looking for a newspaper article.
Have you looked in the periodicals?
I didn't even think about that.
I can show you where they are.
That would be a lot of help.
Follow me, please.
Thank you so much.
How are you?
I'm great
Thanks.
Did you need something?
I need your help.
How may I help you?
I need to find this newspaper article.
Have you checked the periodicals section yet?
I forgot about that section.

How's it going?
I'm fine
Thank you.

I'm going to be fine
Order in the court! 
I would like to make my plea.
What is it
I would like to plead not guilty.
You do realize that all the evidence points to you?
I know
But I did not do it.
How do you figure that?
I didn't commit the crime.
Do you know who did?
If I tell you who did, will you release me?
I'm sure we can work out some kind of deal.
I'll tell you all you need to know.
Order!
Your Honor, I am ready to make my plea.
What's your plea?
I am pleading not guilty.
But all the evidence points to you.
I am not the guilty party
What are you saying?
I am not the person who committed that crime.
Who is?
Will you let me go if I tell you?
We can work something out.
I have no problem singing like a canary.
I need order in the court!

I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed.
Who is the guilty party?
I'll tell you if you let me go.
I'd be glad to make a deal with you.
I am willing to tell you that information
Do you know why I pulled you over?
I have no idea.
Your left brake light is out.
I was not aware of that.
I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
You can't give me a break?
I'm just doing my job.
How much is the ticket for?
You will get that information in court.
I have to go to court?
That's right.
Fine
Give me the ticket.
Do you have any idea why I pulled you over today?
I'm not sure.
One of your brake lights is out.
Really
I'm sorry
I did not know that.
I'm going to give you a ticket.
Why can't you just let me off with a warning?
It's just a ticket.
How much is the fine?
The judge will let you know.
I have to be at court?
Of course.
All right
Just give me the ticket.
Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over?
No, sir.
I pulled you over because your brake light is out.
I'm sorry
I did not know that.
I have to write you a ticket.
Can't you give me a warning?
I'm not going to be able to do that.
How much will the fine be?
You'll find that out on your court date.
I have to go to court over a brake light?
That's how it works.
Can I have the ticket, please
I don't understand why I'm being arrested.
You have a warrant.
A warrant for what?
Apparently, you have a bench warrant.
What does that mean?
You missed a court appearance.
I wasn't aware that I had to go to court.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't find this fair.
Life isn't fair.
Don't I have any rights?
You have the right to remain silent.
Why are you arresting me?
There is a warrant out for your arrest.
What kind of warrant?
You have a bench warrant.
What is that?
Have you missed a court date?
I never went to court.
I can't help you.
This is unfair.
A lot of things aren't fair
That's life.
I have rights, don't I?
You have the right to an attorney.
Why am I being arrested?
You have a warrant out for your arrest.
I don't have a warrant.
My computer shows that you have a bench warrant.
I don't know what a bench warrant is.
You apparently missed a court appearance.
I was never told to go to court.
There's nothing I can do about that.
This isn't fair.
That's life.
What about my rights?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law

I've looked all over the place for the mall.
The mall is in the same place as the movie theater.

It's over on Washington Boulevard.
Is it in that plaza?
That's the place.
I know exactly where the plaza is.

It's newly opened
Do you need help with something?
I'm trying to find something.
What are you looking for?
I'm trying to find a church.
What kind of church is it?
It's a Catholic church.

Thank you
Are you new in town?
Yes, I did just move in.
How do you like it here so far?
I think it's great.
Where did you move from?
I was living in El Salvador.
Why did you decide to move?
I figured I could have a better life here.
Is life hard there?
There aren't many opportunities for people.
Was it hard for you to move?
It was hard, but I know my life will be better here.
Did you just move here?
Yes, I just moved here.
Do you like it here so far?
I love it here.
Where did you come from?
I came from El Salvador.
Why'd you move?
I want to make a life for myself.
Is that hard to do there?
It's harder to make a good life there.
So, was it easy for you to leave?
It wasn't easy, but things will work out better for me here.
Are you new here?
I moved here a couple weeks ago.
What do you think of it here?
I like it here
It's very nice.
Where were you living before?
I was living in El Salvador.
Why'd you leave?
I wanted to start a better life for myself here.
You couldn't do that there?
It's not easy to do well there.
It must've been hard for you to leave.
I miss home, but I'm happy to start a new life here
Are you new in town?
Yes, I am new in town.
It's very nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too.
How long has it been since you moved here?
It's been a month.
Do you like it here so far?

Nice to meet you too.

I moved here about a month ago.
What do you think of it so far?
It's great.
Don't you think that it's beautiful here?
It really is gorgeous.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Thank you for making me feel welcome
I just recently moved into the neighborhood.
Is that right
How recently?
Just last week.
What kinds of things have you been doing out here?
I haven't been doing much.
Why not?
I don't know what to do.
There's all sorts of things to do.
Like what?
How about shopping, or seeing a movie, or even going to the beach?
That's more than I've been doing.
There are plenty of things to do out here.
I just moved in recently.
When was this?
About a week ago.
What have you done so far?
Nothing really.
What
Why haven't you been doing anything?
What is there to do?
There's a lot that you can do.
Name one thing.
You can always go to the beach or catch a movie.
I haven't done any of that.
There's no way for you to be bored here.
I recently moved into town.
When did you move in?
I've been here for only a week.
What have you been doing this past week?
I haven't done much of anything.
Why is that?
I don't know what there is to do.
You can do plenty of things.
Tell me what there is to do.
You can go shopping, go to the beach, or even see a movie.
I didn't know what to do.
There's a lot to do if you just look
Is the moving van here yet?
Yes, it just pulled up to the curb
Here we go! 
Could you double-check and make sure that everything made it into the boxes?
I have already done that
Would you like me to put our suitcases into the car?
Yes, this would be a good time to do that.
I am so glad that we took the time to pack our essentials into suitcases
It will tide us over until the van arrives at our new home.
Would this be a good time to pack the frozen food into the ice chest?
I think that we should wait until the very last minute to do that.
I am going to take the dog for a walk so that he doesn't get too stressed out as the movers are working.
Well, let's get started sweeping up and do a last minute cleaning.
Do you think that the moving van has arrived?
It's coming down the street even as we speak.
Could I ask you to make one last check to make sure that everything got into the boxes?
Relax
Do you need me to put the suitcases in the car?
Yes, let's do that right now
It was such a good idea to pack a suitcase to have some things with us while we are waiting for the moving van to arrive on the other end.
Maybe we could pack the frozen food into the ice chest?
Let's wait until the van is almost completely loaded to take care of that.
I am sure happy that we dropped the cats off at the kennel so they aren't freaking out.
I am going to start sweeping up the floor
I want the new owners to not have to clean up a mess.
Could you check and see if the moving van is out there yet?
It just arrived
They are parking at the curb right now.
Do me a favor and do one last walk-through to check for anything that may not have gotten packed.
We've already double-checked everything
Should we put the suitcases in the car?
It is the perfect time to take care of that.
I am so happy that we didn't pack all of our clothes into boxes
The suitcase of clothes will help us get to what we need until our boxes arrive.
Should we empty the freezer into the ice chest?
Let's do a few more things and then take care of that as one of the last things we do.
Deciding to keep the birds at the neighbors until we leave was a good idea.
Let's sweep the floor on our way out so we don't leave too big of a mess behind
Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home?
The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done
Then number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.
What kinds of things should be on my list?
First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by having a garage sale.
That is a good idea because I have way too much junk.
You also should schedule your moving van in advance.
Can I begin packing things ahead of time?
Yes, just keep in mind what you won't be using in the near future and pack those items first.
Should I schedule my utilities to be shut off?
You need to work that out ahead of time with your utility companies and the new owners.
I was wondering if you had any useful suggestions for how to prepare for our moving day.
Make a prioritized list of what needs to be done and when
Many things can be done ahead of time.
Can you give me some suggestions for my list?
Many people have a garage sale to avoid moving things that they no longer use.
That would certainly cut down on the price of moving.
Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.
Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing?
Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need
Save only a few things until right before your moving date.
When should I have my utilities shut off?
It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.
I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions.
I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along
The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.
What things do people usually put on their moving-out list?
One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by having a garage sale.
That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things.
List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.
Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving?
You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.
I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the people who are moving in.
You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.
I really need help knowing what to do about transferring the deed of my house.
The work of legally transferring the deed of your house will be taken care of in escrow.
What is the first thing that they will do?
The first thing they do is a title search to make sure that there are no liens against your property.
What if I have a lien against my property?
Your home cannot be sold until you clear all liens.
How long will the escrow take?
You can control some aspects of the length of your escrow but not all
Complete all paperwork in a timely fashion.
So, how many days will it take?
An escrow can take anywhere from thirty to ninety days.
I know nothing about transferring the deed of my home.
The escrow company will be doing all of the work in transferring your deed.
What is the first step in transferring the deed?
A deed transfer always includes a title search to make sure that there are no outstanding liens against the property.
What if they discover a lien against my property?
A title transfer cannot occur until you clear all liens.
Will my escrow take long?
To move your escrow along, it is important to supply all documents that are requested in a timely fashion.
What is the length of the average escrow?
The average escrow will last anywhere from thirty to ninety days.
I think that I am going to hire a lawyer to help me transfer the deed of my house.
Don't worry
The escrow company will be helping us with transferring the deed.
How do they begin the process of transferring the deed?
A title search is necessary to make sure that there are no liens against your property.
What will happen if they find a lien against my property?
All liens against the property must be cleared before the sale of your house can continue.
How can I shorten my escrow?
Make sure that you accurately complete all paperwork in a timely fashion
This will help shorten the length of your escrow.
How many days will it take to close the escrow?
Thirty to ninety days is about how long it takes to complete an escrow
I heard that the potential buyer is interested in me carrying part of a loan for him.
Carrying part of a loan can be a good or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances.
What would be an advantage of me carrying a note on the house?
If you don't need the money right away, you can earn a fairly good interest rate.
Why does my buyer want me to carry part of his loan?
In this economy, buyers sometimes have trouble getting a loan even when they have good credit.
What are the risks to me?
The risk is that the market could drop drastically and the owner would walk away.
How long will I need to commit to financing this loan?
You need to make an agreement with the buyer as to how long you will carry this note.
My potential buyer has asked me to carry part of his loan.
The decision to carry part of a loan might be advantageous to you or problematic.
Why would I ever want to carry a note on a house?
It is a type of investment that can offer a fairly steady return over a set period of time.
Why is my buyer requesting that I carry part of his loan?
Oftentimes buyers are well able to afford the home but unable to qualify for a loan.
Are there any risks in carrying a second mortgage?
You are basically betting on the fact that the home is not going to drastically fall in price
This could leave you with a house that is not worth much.
Will I be financing this loan for a set period of time?
That is entirely up to you and the buyer.
If the purchaser of your home wants you to carry part of the loan, is that good?
Carrying a loan could be good or bad for you as a seller.
Why would it be a good thing to carry a note on my own house?
For investors who can afford to have their money tied up, it can offer a fairly nice return.
What advantage is my buyer looking for in having me carry him on paper?
We are seeing more and more buyers who are not able to qualify for a loan and are able to take out a second mortgage with the owner.
Can I lose my money if I carry a second mortgage?
It is an investment and carries some risks
You are counting on the housing market to not go into a tailspin.
Is there a certain amount of time that I will be carrying this loan?
The buyer and seller set the year for the loan to come due
Your office called and left a message that several offers had come in on our home.
Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!
Were the offers for a good price?
One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.
Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!
Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the most money.
What other factors do I need to consider?
We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to purchase the house.
How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home?
We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount that they need
This information will help you make a good decision.
When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision.
When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.
I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house.
It has been quite a busy day regarding your home
We just received three offers!
Did the potential buyers offer a good price?
There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly for the asking price.
The highest bid is always the best bid!
We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.
What things would you like me to look at?
Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have the credit to purchase the home.
How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home?
We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment
A large amount of available cash would be a good sign.
I will wait for that information and give you my answer.
Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the buyers.
My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home.
The Open House was quite a success
Last night we received three offers on your home!
I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received!
Offers above and below the asking price came in
One was right on the money.
Let's go with the highest bid!
We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.
What matters besides getting the money for the house?
We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even purchase a home.
I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.
We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home
This would make them more desirable
I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me.
Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.
I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer.
Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own.
Is the counteroffer close to the asking price?
The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.
I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing.
I agree that that price is too low
Your home is in good shape, and you should get a better price for it.
What should I do at this point?
Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are rejecting their latest offer.
Can you take care of that for me and get back to me?
I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you will accept.
Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my counteroffer?
Yes, I was going to call you this morning
Your buyers have responded with a counteroffer.
Is the counteroffer a good one?
They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.
That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go.
I think that your feelings are valid
You have a beautiful home and can afford to wait for a better offer.
What is the next step?
You can flat-out reject their offer and see what they come up with.
I would like you to notify them that I am rejecting their offer.
I will notify the buyers that you will not accept their counteroffer.
I was wondering if the buyers have accepted my counteroffer.
Yes, I just faxed you the information an hour ago
The buyers have a counteroffer for you.
How much did they counteroffer?
They now are offering to pay ten thousand less than your asking price.
I am not really ready to accept that low of a price.
I wouldn't accept that price either
Your home is in a good area and should command a higher price.
Where do we go from here?
We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer
They might choose to offer a higher price.
Please let the buyers know that I am rejecting their offer.
I will take care of that right away
They may or may not raise their offer
My assistant called and said that you had received a response to our counteroffer.
Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.
Did they accept the counteroffer?
They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you wanted.
What do you think about their offer?
I think that this is a good offer
They also would like to have a 90-day escrow to allow them to sell their home
The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us.
They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.
That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions.
I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer
They will be very pleased!
I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our counteroffer.
Yes, the response just came through on the fax machine.
Was the counteroffer acceptable to them?
They made their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you proposed.
Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable?
Their offer is a good one
They also want to have a short escrow as they have already sold their home and are ready to move in.
We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.
They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.
I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.
I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of their counteroffer
I am sure they will be excited!
I was calling in to see if there had been any response from the buyers regarding my counteroffer.
Yes, the buyer's agent just contacted me while I was at an Open House.
Did they state whether the counteroffer worked for them or not?
They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower
They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.
In your professional opinion, is this a good offer?
Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer
They also want a short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now
We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer.
They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major problems with the house before this is a solid deal.
Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept their counteroffer.
The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.
I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our house.
Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning.
Is the offer a good offer?
The offer is pretty good
You asked three hundred thousand and they offered two hundred eighty thousand.
I would be willing to take two hundred ninety thousand, but no lower.
You could make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars
Would you like to do that?
Yes, I would like to make the counteroffer.
I will make the counteroffer immediately by phone.
What if they don't accept the counteroffer?
They can make a counteroffer themselves or state that their first offer stands.
I got a message on my machine that you received an offer on my house.
Yes, the offer came in late last night
It was too late to call you.
Is the offer as high as we were hoping for?
They offered two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you were asking three hundred thousand dollars
They are definitely in the ballpark.
I was prepared to go a little lower, but more like two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
Would you like to make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars?
I definitely would like to make a counteroffer.
I will FAX them the counteroffer right away.
What if my counteroffer gets turned down?
They have an option of making a counteroffer, or they can just reject your counteroffer.
Your office called and said that an offer came in on our house.
Yes, the offer came in less than an hour ago.
How good of an offer did we receive?
Their bid was two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you said that you wanted three hundred thousand dollars
Their bid is a reasonable start.
We built a little leeway into the asking price, but I don't want to accept less than two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
Sellers frequently make a counteroffer
Would you like to counteroffer two hundred ninety thousand dollars?
I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point.
I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.
What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer?
If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or come up with a counteroffer of their own
So how much did the buyers bid on our house?
Your asking price was three hundred thousand dollars
The potential buyers offered two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
That's a great offer!
Yes, it is a good offer
Before you accept, we should look at some details.
What else do we need to look at?
They want you to pay all closing costs
Of course, they are making the sale contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house.
I think that that sounds fair.
You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their eye on another house down the street.
I definitely want to accept their offer.
Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.
I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house!
Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars
The first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
That's way better than I expected so early in the game!
The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole picture.
What are the other considerations?
They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the inspector
If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal.
I don't have a problem with that.
You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale.
Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer.
I think that you are making the right choice
I will phone the buyers right away!
What did the buyers offer us on our house?
With the original asking price at three hundred thousand dollars, the buyers are willing to pay two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
I am really pleased with that offer.
I agree that the offer is in the ballpark
We need to consider everything before you accept.
Besides the selling price, what else is there to consider?
They want you to pay to have the cracks in the back wall fixed and a couple of the roof tiles replaced.
All of that is acceptable to me.
A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close to your asking price
You could risk losing the sale.
I wish to officially accept their offer.
This is a win-win situation for both you and the buyer
I am sure that you will both be happy with your decision
What should I do to get ready for the Open House?
Your house needs to be as clean and uncluttered as possible.
Can we stay in the house while it is being shown?
No one is to be in the house during the Open House except for the realtor and the potential buyers who are looking at the house.
Can we leave our dog in the backyard during the Open House?
Absolutely no pets are to remain in the house during Open House
Take them with you or board them, please.
I have a lot of expensive jewelry and am afraid to leave it in the house
We will do our best to watch over your things, but expensive jewelry and guns need to go with you.
How will we know when to come home?
The Open House will last from eleven o'clock until four o'clock.
Is there anything special I should do to get ready for our Open House this weekend?
Just make sure that your house is perfectly clean and that everything is put away.
My husband wants to watch the game, and we were wondering if he could stay in his den during Open House.
Everyone in the household must leave the premises before potential buyers arrive.
Can the cat stay on the bed during Open House?
No pets are allowed at the Open House! Maybe your neighbor would let your pets stay over there for a few hours.
Where can I hide my expensive jewelry?
If you have a safe, put your jewelry in there
Otherwise, please take your valuables with you.
Will you let us know when everyone has left?
Usually the Open Houses last until four o'clock
If this one ends earlier, I will call you on your cell phone.
What suggestions do you have for preparing for the Open House on Saturday?
The two most important things are that your home is clean and clutter free.
My mother is old and wants to stay in her room during the Open House.
Absolutely no occupants of the house are to be present during an Open House.
We have several pet snakes and would like them to stay in the garage during Open House.
You wouldn't want someone to hate your house because they can't stand animals, would you
Your pets need to disappear for a bit!
Will someone be watching to make sure my expensive jewelry doesn't get ripped off?
We have two realtors to keep an eye on things at all times, but please don't keep valuable jewelry or guns in your home when it is being shown.
What time will the Open House be over?
You can come home at four o'clock if you like
If it is rainy and slow, I will call you if I decide to end it a little early
Can you help me figure out some inexpensive ways to fix up the exterior of my home?
Like the interior, the number one thing you can do is to repaint the outside of your home if it needs it.
What do you think of the landscaping?
Your lawn looks really good
Perhaps you could get some timers installed for your sprinklers.
How about adding some flowers or something?
Colorful flowers are always a nice addition to a yard to add curb appeal.
What about fixing up the backyard?
Make sure the lawn is well trimmed and the bushes are cut back.
Can you think of any more overall suggestions for the exterior?
Wash all of the windows inside and out.
What can I do to fix up the exterior of my home?
I would say the number one thing that you can do is paint your home, but your home has been painted recently and looks great!
What can I do about the landscaping?
Your lawn looks a little dried out
I think all it needs is a little fertilizer and water.
My front yard looks a little boring
How can I brighten it up?
I would definitely put in some new plantings to liven your yard up a bit.
Should I be worried about what my backyard looks like?
You need to repair that section where your fence is falling down.
What else can I do to make the exterior of the house look extra good to buyers?
Make sure to keep the sidewalks and driveways swept clean at all times.
I keep hearing about curb appeal and want to know how to achieve it.
The paint job on your home looks pretty good, but I would touch up the wooden trim a little where you have some peeling spots.
I am not so sure that everyone will like the landscaping.
Your lawn is a disaster! To get top dollar for your home, you should replace it.
Is there anything I can do to add some interest to my front yard?
You have beautiful plants in your yard, although some of them aren't in bloom right now
Just add a few colorful flowers in pots.
Is the appearance of the backyard important?
If you can borrow some really nice patio furniture to show off your lovely patio, that would be nice.
Any final suggestions on how I can make the exterior of my house even more appealing?
Having your trees and bushes trimmed could be a good investment
So, during the time that you are showing my house, how will my valuables be protected?
Our real estate company takes every precaution to see that your valuables are protected at all times.
How will I know when someone will be looking at my home?
We will typically give you at least 4 hours notice on a weekend before we come by.
Will you always accompany whoever is looking at my house?
Your house is listed on the multiple listing
That means that people from a variety of real estate offices will be showing your home
How will the realtors get into my house if I am not at home?
We put a lockbox on your house
The realtors will have a key to the lockbox and then they can get a key to your front door.
What about people watching my stuff during an Open House?
We always suggest that you either store your jewelry in a safe or move it into a friend's house while your house is being shown.
I am worried about the security of my home while it is being shown.
We do everything we can to protect your home and your valuables
Do people just come and look whenever they want to?
During the week, we will let you know the night before if we will be bringing someone by the next day.
I am assuming that someone from your office will always be there, right?
Your home is listed exclusively with our office
We will be the only ones showing your home.
Does everyone have a copy of my house key?
Realtors have a special key to what is called a lockbox
Once they get into the lockbox, they can get a key to the house.
I have heard horror stories from friends about being ripped off during their Open House.
Our company has invested in several cameras that we place in the key rooms while the house is being shown.
I have heard horror stories about people's things being stolen while their house is being shown.
We have a very good track record when it comes to home security.
I am not so sure that I like the idea of people showing up whenever they want to pop in!
We will always call at least 12 hours in advance if we are bringing someone by to see your home.
Are you the only one showing my house?
To get maximum exposure and a variety of buyers, your home is listed on the multiple listing
Many different realtors will be showing your home.
Do you have to come and let the different realtors in when they come to look at my house?
The realtors can get a key to your house by unlocking a lockbox on your front door
They use it while they are there and return it when they leave.
The thing I worry about the most is having my valuables stolen during an Open House.
Our realtors try to be very aware at all times of who is in the house and what they are doing
So what do you think I should do to fix up the interior of my house?
A fresh coat of paint is the number one improvement that you can make to your home.
What colors do you think would be best?
You need to go with fairly neutral tones
You want fairly contemporary colors that will go with a variety of furnishings.
After paint, what is the next most important improvement that I can make?
Remove any extra furnishings and personal items
Make your home look as uncluttered as possible.
Should I get a new carpet?
Your carpet is in really good shape
New owners typically want to pick out their own carpeting.
How about improvements to the bathroom?
New faucets are not that expensive and can quickly add a clean and more up-to-date look.
What are your suggestions for some inexpensive fixes to help me get the best price for my home?
Painting the interior of your home is not that expensive and greatly improves the appearance of your home.
Should I go for trendy colors or more traditional tones?
You don't want to make any dramatic statements with paint, but don't go with just white either.
What else can I do besides paint the inside of my home to improve its value
You need to get rid of any extra furniture or knick-knacks.
I need to know if I should replace the carpeting.
Your carpeting is very worn
You might want to explore buying some attractive inexpensive carpeting.
How about improvements to the kitchen?
You could inexpensively replace the linoleum flooring; that would really brighten things up.
What do people usually do to improve the interior of their houses before they sell them?
Your house looks very nice on the inside, but a fresh coat of paint always helps brighten a home's interior.
I get confused when trying to pick out colors that other people might like.
Lighter neutral colors are usually best
They make rooms appear larger.
The painting suggestion is a good one, but after that, what improvement will add value to my home?
Your interior should have only the most basic of furniture
Either store or get rid of any extra clutter.
What about replacing the floor covering?
I know that your carpeting is not brand new, but with a good steam cleaning, I think that it will look great.
Is there anything that I can do to the bathrooms and kitchen that wouldn't cost too much?
New curtains or blinds do not cost that much and brighten up any room
My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract.
Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it.
How much does a lawyer cost?
I don't know
A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.
That can't be legal! 
Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.
Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that?
You'd have to check the yellow pages or go online.
There's no telling how many hours the lawyer will charge me for.
Also, it might take a week or two just to get an appointment.
I'd rather get this over with, so just show me where to sign.
Good man! I've marked all the places for you to sign and date.
My wife said to have a lawyer look at the contract.
That's always a good idea.
Do you know how much a lawyer runs?
I've heard that they're about $400 an hour.
Who can afford that?
A few years ago, $100 an hour was outrageous.
Can you help me find a cheaper lawyer?
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.
The lawyer will start at $400, but where will it end?
Also, a good lawyer might not have time to see you immediately.
My wife's going to kill me, but just show me where to sign.
Now you're talking
The red stickers indicate where to sign and date.
My wife told me to get a lawyer to review the contract first.
A smart husband always does what his wife tells him.
How much are lawyers charging nowadays?
It's hard to believe, but I think they charge about $400 an hour.
That's highway robbery!
I think lawyers are making twice what doctors are making.
Are there any lawyers that are cheaper than that?
The best advice I can give you is to Google it.
I can barely afford one hour, but certainly not two.
Remember, it might take a few days just to set up an appointment.
I really don't have the time or the money, so where do I sign?
Your wife will thank you
Just sign and date where the little red stickers are
How much do you think that I should ask for my house?
Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
What do you look at when setting an asking price?
We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area
These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high
Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?
Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?
The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth
Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home?
You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?
You should be realistic in your pricing
Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?
We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.
What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
What is involved in figuring out an asking price?
We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?
You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price
However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar
More often than not, that strategy backfires.
Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers?
If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it
Thank you for coming to look at my house.
I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.
When will people come to look at my house?
Basically, there are two ways people can view your home
They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.
Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office?
Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
Will I know when people are going to come see my house?
We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
What happens during an Open House day?
You will be expected to be away during an Open House
I will take care of the details.
I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.
It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.
How do you show my home to potential buyers?
We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.
Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?
We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing
That way, people who don't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
How will I know when to expect prospective buyers?
That will be set in your contract
Usually, you will be given four hours notice.
Can I stay home during an Open House day?
The seller is never at home during an Open House
I personally will handle the showing of your home.
Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.
I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.
When can people come and see my home?
We will have several Open House weekends
Various realtors will also show your house during the week.
Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers?
Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing
That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.
Can people just drop in anytime they feel like it?
We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.
Will I have to go away during an Open House day?
I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House
The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else!
I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
You have come to the right place
When were you interested in selling your home?
I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
How long have you been in your current home?
I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year
People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.
What is the next step in selling my home?
I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.
I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have
When 
were you thinking of selling your home?
I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own.
Have you owned your home for a long time?
I just bought my home two years ago.
I think you probably know that the market is not all that great
You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home
Then we can draw up a contract.
I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.
It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have
Were you interested in selling in the near future?
I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii.
Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away.
Housing prices have fallen quite a bit
The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.
Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?
It will all kind of even out
You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
What should we be doing to get the process started?
If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property
The next step would be us both signing a contract.

Not a problem, sir
Please remember us in the future
I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends
Is that okay?
All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up.
All of that's on the package
Can I just bring it down to your desk?
That would be most convenient for me
Thanks for your consideration!
I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up
Can I do that?
Just tell me your name, your friend's name, and when your friend is coming by.
I'll put all that information on the package and just bring it down to you
Is that okay?
That sounds great, sir
Thank you.
Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?
I just need your name and your friend's name
Also, tell me when he is coming by.
How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?
Perfect
Thank you for doing that.
I've got a parcel here that a friend is going to pick up
Can I leave it with you?
No problem
Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by.
I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you.
Sir, you make my work too easy
Thank you.
A friend is picking up a parcel
Can I leave the parcel with you?
By all means, sir
Just give me your name, his name, and when he will be coming by.
I can put all of that right on the package and then bring it down to you, if that's okay.
Well, thank you for doing that, sir
I wish all guests were like you
I'm checking out in about half an hour.
Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.
Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
You're right
It's only 9:00 a.m.
Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more
But I need to store my bags.
Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour
You also need to leave a deposit.
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?
Unfortunately, it isn't
VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.
Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment.
Better hurry, sir
Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.
I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.
I'm ready when you are, sir.
Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.
You are so right, sir
The clock just struck nine.
I'm going to spend some time exploring the city
What can I do with my luggage?
Sir, right here we have a storage site
Its only $5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.
A deposit
Isn't my luggage a deposit?
I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't
Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely.
Let me think about this.
Okay, sir
But don't take too long
You only have 30 minutes.
Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?
Just say the word, sir.
Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun.
I agree
The dew is still on the grass.
I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my luggage.
We do have a storage space for your bags
There's a small charge, plus a deposit.
Leave a deposit
Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?
Regrettably, no
But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.
I'll have to think about this for a second.
Okay, sir, but don't think too long
Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.
In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour.
That won't be a problem, sir.
That's good to hear
Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me.
You're right, sir
Your whole day is still ahead of you.
I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure my baggage.
We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.
A deposit, huh
I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit.
Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.
That deposit bothers me
Give me a minute.
Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.
I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes.
Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you.
Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
There's nothing like getting an early start, sir.
What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?
You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.
Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?
I wish it was, but it isn't
They will still want a credit card.
It's always something, isn't it
Let me think about this for a second
Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check out
My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never ordered one.
Let's see
It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m
for the movie "Titanic."
That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.
Okay, let me see what I can do.
Thank you
I didn't think it would be this simple.
I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the service.
Are you serious
I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.
This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!
I'm sorry, sir
Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered.
Let me check, sir
You were charged for watching "Titanic" Monday night.
That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night.
Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.
Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word.
One slight problem, sir
I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from your file.
You can't be serious
You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
I feel your pain, sir.
Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves
I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.
You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.
Let's see, sir
According to your file, you watched "Titanic" Monday evening.
The wrong information is in my file
I was at a concert Monday night.
Well, your word overrules the file, sir
One moment, please.
I knew you'd see it my way.
Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.
Am I in the Twilight Zone
You're charging me for a movie I never saw?
Please don't blame me, sir
Blame the computer programmer.
This is highway robbery
I've got a good mind to call the police!
If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.
Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?
Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching "Titanic."
The file is wrong
I was at a great concert that night.
Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong
Just a moment, please.
Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.
Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service charge.
You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!
Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.
Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!
I don't blame you, sir
Two dollars is a lot of money.
I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered.
Hmm
Your file shows that you watched "Titanic" Monday night.
Monday night
Monday night I was at a great concert.
Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out
Let me correct this error, please.
Thank you
It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly.
When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.
Are you crazy
You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake?
Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.
Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?
Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not
I am checking out
Here is the key to my room.
Thank you
I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go
Here you go!
Thanks.
If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?
This hotel could use some insecticide, but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful.
That's very honest of you
Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time.
I want to check out
Here is my room key.
One second, sir, while I print out your receipt
Here you are.
Thanks.
May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?
Except for one night, I enjoyed the hotel
And I loved New York, of course.
Thank you for your honesty
I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time.
I'm leaving
Here is my key.
Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?
Most of my time here was pleasant
And New York itself is fantastic.
I'm glad you enjoyed the city, anyway
But please don't think too unkindly of us.
I'm out of here
Here's my key.
Give me just a few seconds, sir, and I'll hand you your receipt
Here you are.
I thank you.
I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir.
I only had nine little problems here
Other than that, I enjoyed my stay, and I loved the city.
I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir
I hope you have a nice trip home.
My stay is over
Here's the key to my room.
Thank you
And here's your receipt, sir.
Many thanks.
I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir.
This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects
The city itself is great.
I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit
Please have a pleasant trip home.
This visit is over for me
Here's your room key.
Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt.
And thanks to you.
I hope you'll visit us again, sir.
I'd be willing to try this hotel again, if you can promise me no more cockroaches.
I guarantee you that our little “friends” won't be back
I hope your trip home is pleasant
I need to get a taxi.
We have a variety of transportation services
Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi?
No, that won't be necessary
I just need a taxi.
Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine
That's such a stylish way to travel.
Just a taxi, please.
And what is your destination?
I'm going to Rockefeller Center.
I see
What time do you want to depart from the hotel?
I want to leave as soon as possible.
Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir.
Thank you, I'm coming down now.
It won't be but a few seconds, sir.
I need a taxi, please.
We have various transportation services
Would you prefer a private vehicle?
No, thanks
A taxi is just fine.
May I suggest a limo
It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while.
I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you.
I understand
And where will you be going?
Rockefeller Center.
And what time would you like to be picked up?
The sooner the better.
A taxi will be here shortly, sir.
Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo.
A taxi it is, sir.
Can you get me a taxi?
We offer various types of transportation
Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle?
Thanks, but no thanks
A taxi will do just fine.
In that case, how about a limo
Then you can travel in style.
No, I hate limousines
They're gas guzzlers.
Got it, sir
Where would you like the taxi to take you?
My destination is Rockefeller Center.
What time do you want to leave the hotel?
As soon as possible.
I'll call the taxi immediately, sir.
I'm coming downstairs now.
A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir.
I'm going to need a taxi.
You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi
We can offer you a private vehicle.
A private vehicle, huh
No, a taxi is okay.
Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi.
No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo.
No upgrade of any kind
And where might you be going?
I'm headed to Rockefeller Center.
When shall I tell the taxi to be here?
Right now.
The taxi will be here immediately, sir.
Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute.
You won't have to wait a second, sir.
I need a taxi.
We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer.
No, the taxi will do.
Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine.
No, thank you
Taxis and I get along just fine.
No private vehicle, no limo
Got it
Where are you going?
I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center.
What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?
I'm ready to go right now.
I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.
Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs.
You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.
Could you please reserve a taxi for me?
Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?
A private vehicle
No, thanks, I won't need one.
Even better than a private vehicle is a limo
How does that sound?
T A X I, please.
A taxi it is
Where will you be headed
Rockefeller Center
Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?
A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir.
Good
I'll get my coat and come downstairs.
The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?
We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations.
What exactly does that mean?
Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.
That sounds really neat
Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?
If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.
Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?
To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7:00 a.m
till 10:00 p.m
I'll go down there as soon as I can!
I don't think you'll be disappointed
People really seem to like the swim stations.
Does this hotel have a pool?
I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one
However, in our gym, we do have swim stations.
I'm not sure I understand.
Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.
Cool
What will they think of next
How much are they?
Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.
Excellent! Now what are the hours?
The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m
to 10 p.m
only.
I'm going to change into my trunks right now!
I think you'll like the experience, sir
It's a great workout.
Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?
We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.
I never heard of a swim station
Is that like a train or bus station?
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.
Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing
How much do they cost?
As a guest, sir, you pay nothing.
This sounds better every second
Now, when can I use the stations?
If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m
and 10 p.m
Oh, boy! This is going to be great
I'm going to the gym right now!
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir
Everyone seems to like the swim stations.
I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here.
This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
Swim stations
Whoever heard of such a thing?
You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.
All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?
The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.
Very good
Now can you tell me the hours of operation?
They're available anytime between 7 a.m
and 10 p.m., seven days a week.
Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!
The swim stations are very popular, sir
I hope you don't find a line down there.
I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet.
We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
Swim stations
Could you be a little more explicit?
You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere
Well, it's the same thing.
Gee, that's a great idea
Now, how much do I have to pay?
The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.
Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?
The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m
to 10 p.m.
Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks.
Be warned, sir
At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded
I'd like to order a restock on my minibar.
You finished everything in there, sir?
Absolutely everything
What would you like to order?
Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.
Uh-huh
What else do you want?
The apples were great
Could you bring a couple more up?
No problem
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Some grape juice would also be nice.
I'll get all of that for you right away
Someone should be up shortly.
I need my minibar restocked.
Everything is gone, sir?
There's not a drop left of anything.
Is there anything in particular you'd like?
Yes, the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot
Let me have three more of each.
Got it
Anything else?
I really liked the apples
Bring me a couple of apples, please.
Not a problem
Anything else?
Yes, one more thing: some grape juice.
Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.
My minibar is empty.
You already finished off everything, sir?
I finished off everything.
Would you like anything in particular?
The Perrier and the Jim Beam
Let me have three more of each.
Beam and Perrier
Anything else, sir?
I really loved the apples in my room
Bring me a few more, please.
Sure thing
Might there by anything else?
Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too.
Perrier, Jim Beam, apples, and grape juice
It will all be there shortly, sir.
How do I restock my minibar?
You've drunk everything, sir?
I finished it all.
Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?
Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.
That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers
Anything else, sir?
The apples in my room were delicious
Bring me a few more, please.
Okay
Are you sure there isn't anything else?
You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too.
Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door.
My minibar is completely empty.
Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?
Everything's gone
Is there anything special you'd like?
Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier.
Okay, sir
Three of each
Would you like anything else?
The fruit basket was great
I need a few more apples, please.
Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples
Is that it for now?
Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice.
Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir
I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop.
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you the payment options
I don't have an Ethernet port
My computer runs entirely on wireless service.
That's too bad
But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them.
Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives.
We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.
Very good
How much does that cost?
The service is free to hotel patrons
However, printing costs ten cents per page.
I see
And the other alternatives?
Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby
You can bring your laptop down here.
Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?
You would have to use the computer lab
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I need broadband for my computer.
No problem
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good to go.
That's a problem
My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only.
Hmm
Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested.
Go ahead
I'm all ears.
We have a computer lab on the first floor.
That's great! How much is it?
It's absolutely free to guests
Except for printing, of course.
What about the other alternatives?
You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.
Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?
Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet
You'll have to use the lab.
I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.
There's an Ethernet cable in your room
Just plug it into the back of your laptop.
I can't use Ethernet
My computer is wireless only.
That's okay
I can tell you about some alternatives we have.
Any alternative that works will be great.
Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.
That sounds good
What's the charge?
The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print.
That sounds good
Now, how about the other alternatives?
Of course
Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here.
Use my laptop in the lobby
That's great! Now, if I need to print something there?
They plan to install a printer here
But until then, you'll have to use the lab.
I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup.
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and running.
That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port
Unfortunately, my laptop uses wireless only.
In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives.
Anything to get me up and running.
For starters, we have a computer lab.
Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?
The lab is completely free
But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing.
That's fine
Now tell me about the other alternatives.
Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby
We're set up for wireless right here.
Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?
Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.
How do I get online with my laptop?
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a heartbeat
I see the cable
But my computer runs on wireless only.
No problem
I'll tell you about our alternatives.
Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are
Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.
Great! But is it free?
Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee.
You said there were other alternatives?
Just use your computer here in the lobby
It's set up for wireless.
That sounds like a winner
Now if I need to print something in the lobby?
We might have a printer here next month
But for now, you'll have to go to the lab
I need a doctor immediately!
Sir, is everything all right?
My wife just collapsed on the floor!
Sir, I need you to calm down
Take deep breaths.
I'm sorry
It's just that my wife
I need the emergency room.
Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line.
What's taking you so long?
I'm transferring you right now
Just remain calm.
Help me! I need a doctor!
What is the problem, sir?
My wife is on the floor!
Sir, please calm down
Take a deep breath.
I need some help, right now!
Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911.
Hurry, please!
I'm transferring you right now, sir.
I need a doctor right now!
Tell me the problem, sir.
My wife just passed out!
Sir, it's difficult to understand you
Please take a deep breath and calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!
I'm getting 911 on another line, sir.
Okay, but hurry.
Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly.
Get a doctor here, immediately!
What's the problem, sir?
My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!
Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?
Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!
Hold on just a second, sir
I'm dialing 911.
Hurry up, please.
I'm connecting you now, sir.
A doctor! I need a doctor! 
Give me some details, sir.
Something is wrong with my wife
She's lying on the floor.
Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself
You're right, I'm beside myself with worry.
Hold on, sir
I'm connecting you with 911.
Time is critical
Hurry up!
I hope everything turns out well, sir
Here's 911
I need to copy a document immediately.
We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor.
Great! How much is it for a copy?
The price per copy is ten cents.
That sounds reasonable
I'll be down there immediately.
THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir.
I need to copy something right now.
Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir.
Great! How much per copy?
Sir, one copy is ten cents.
I'll be down there shortly.
You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir.
I need to make a copy of something at once.
There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir.
Fantastic! Is there a charge?
It's ten cents a copy, sir.
I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it.
A dime is still a bargain, sir.
I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible.
No problem, sir
There's a copy machine in our computer lab.
Very good
How much does each copy cost?
Each copy will cost you a dime, sir.
A dime
I remember when copies used to cost a nickel.
There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir.
Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?
Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab
That's great
I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests
Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer
In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy
I'll be right down.
Those were the good old days, sir, indeed
I'd like to request some more amenities.
Amenities
What do you mean by amenities, sir?
The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.
I see
Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?
Not at all
I still have enough for the next few days.
Then what is the problem, sir?
I need some to keep as souvenirs!
Souvenirs?
Yes, souvenirs
Trinkets to remember my trip by!
We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir.
That's not the same
I never pay for hotel souvenirs!
I'll call housekeeping
Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.
I need more amenities, please.
Could you be a little more specific, sir?
To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo.
I understand
Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities?
No! I've got all I need for my stay here.
So, what's the problem?
I need souvenirs!
You want some souvenirs!
Yes, yes
Souvenirs.
But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.
That's not the same thing
If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no sentimental value.
I understand, sir
I'll call housekeeping
You'll have your souvenirs shortly.
How do I get more amenities?
I'm sorry, sir
I'm not sure I understand.
I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.
Oh, I see
So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.
No, no
I've got plenty left.
Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?
What am I going to do about souvenirs?
Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!
Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.
Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a discount.
Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs.
I understand completely, sir
Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment.
Yes, I need more amenities.
By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?
You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo.
Okay, I got it
You've already run out of all your amenities?
No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day.
I'm more confused now than before
How is there a problem?
I need to take home some souvenirs!
Okay, finally I understand
You would like souvenirs!
Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection.
If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop
It has everything.
Are you kidding
Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?
No problem at all, sir
Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.
I need some more amenities, please.
I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.
Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo.
Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?
No, I'm not even halfway through my supply.
I'm losing you, sir
What's the problem?
What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?
Okay, I got it
You're collecting souvenirs!
There you go
My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs.
Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir
It's loaded with all kinds of items.
I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start now.
Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily
Excuse me
Does this hotel have a fitness facility?
Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness.
Where is your fitness facility located?
The gym is just below the lobby
Take the elevator or the stairs
You can't miss it.
Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?
No, the gym is free to guests
Take your room key, however, so you can get in.
What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?
The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.
Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?
Unfortunately, no
If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym.
Pardon me
Does your hotel have a fitness facility?
Yes, sir
We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness.
Great! Where is it?
Sir, the gym is just below the lobby
You can take the elevator or the stairs.
Do I have to pay extra?
No, sir
It's gratis
Just take your room key so you can get in.
What are the gym hours?
You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7.
Great! Is a trainer available?
I'm sorry, but no
We used to have a trainer, but then he had an unfortunate accident.
Does this hotel have an exercise facility?
But of course! We have a great exercise facility.
Good
Now exactly where is it?
It's located right under our lobby
Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down.
Is this going to cost me anything?
No, sir
The gym is absolutely free
However, be sure to take your room key with you.
When does the gym open and close?
The hours couldn't be better, 24/7.
Very good
Now, is there a trainer down there?
I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't.
Do you have a place where I can exercise?
Yes, sir
We have a fine exercise facility.
I'm happy to hear that
Now, would you tell me where it is?
You're actually standing above it
Just take the elevator or stairs down one level.
Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?
No, sir
There's no extra charge
All you need is your room key to open the door.
And the gym hours are?
Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes.
One more question: Do you have a trainer?
We might be getting one in the near future
But at the present time, no.
Excuse me
Do you happen to have a gym here?
Yes, sir
I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory.
So, where do I go to exercise?
It's only one flight down, sir
Just take the elevator or the stairs.
Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?
Sir, you can use the gym for free
All you need is your room key.
Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?
Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week.
Do you have a trainer to help me work out?
I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer
I want to change rooms
In fact, I want a refund for tonight!
And the problem is, sir?
Cockroaches have taken over my room!
My apologies, sir
We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room.
Thank you
I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others.
We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible.
I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight.
I'm sorry, sir
Exactly what is the problem?
I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!
I'm so sorry, sir
We'll give you a new room immediately, and give you a refund also.
Thank you
I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact.
Sir, we always try to please our guests.
I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight.
Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is.
I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!
My apologies, sir
We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund.
Thank you
I didn't want to have to take this to court.
Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
This room is unacceptable
I want a new one, and I want a refund for tonight.
Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?
I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!
Oh, my gosh, they're back
Another room at once, sir, plus a full refund, of course.
Thank you very much
This has been a most unsettling experience.
Sir, our guests are our reason for being.
This room is unfit for humans
I want another room, and I want a refund for tonight.
Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir.
In a word, cockroaches!
Oh, no, are they back
I'll give you another room immediately, sir, and a refund for tonight.
Thank you
I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars.
Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing.
I want to change rooms
In fact, I want a refund for tonight!
If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful.
Cockroaches have declared war on my room!
Allow me to apologize
I'll give you another room right now, and a full refund for tonight.
Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence
Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do
I have a little problem with room 507.
What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr
Sandals?
I found cockroaches in my room.
Cockroaches, sir
That's unbelievable.
I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room.
Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?
There are nine cockroaches in my room
I don't have time for your disbelief!
I apologize
One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
I'm in 507
I have a few problems with my room.
What is that problem, sir?
There are cockroaches in my room.
Are you sure, sir
Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?
I've counted nine different cockroaches, and I accidentally stepped on another one.
Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel.
You dare to doubt me?
I'm sorry, sir
Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
There's a big problem with my room
I'm in 507.
Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?
I have cockroaches crawling in my room.
Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir.
I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see.
Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?
How dare you question my statement!
Forgive me
You're 100 percent correct
Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor.
There's a major problem with room 507.
I'm sorry to hear that
Please tell me the exact problem.
This room is overrun with cockroaches.
There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir.
I stopped counting at nine.
Sir, this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors.
Your inspector needs spectacles
The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant.
I apologize, sir
Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
I'm in 507, and I have a big problem
I'm so sorry
Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir.
Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches.
Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check.
The next cockroach I see will be number ten.
Mr
Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach.
I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!
You're right, sir
Please let me transfer you to my supervisor.
I have a little problem with room 507.
Problems are what we're here for, sir
Please tell me your problem.
This room is filthy with cockroaches
Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?
I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! 
Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots.
You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!
I'm very sorry, sir
Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor
I'd like to order dinner.
What would you like?
I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
I'm sorry
We're currently out of filet mignon
May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do.
And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne will do for tonight.
Okay, no strawberries
Room service will be charged to your amenities account
Is that all right?
That's fine.
It will be up shortly
Enjoy your food, sir.
Could I order dinner?
Of course
What would you like?
I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
I'm so sorry
We ran out of filet mignon
May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay.
May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Not tonight, thank you.
No strawberries
We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.
Charge it to whatever account you like.
Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready
Enjoy!
Could you bring me some food, please?
Sure
What do you fancy?
Can I have a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare?
Sir, the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out
May I suggest the porterhouse?
No filet
Okay, porterhouse will be fine then.
Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion.
Okay
This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?
No problem.
Your food will be brought to you momentarily
I hope you enjoy it.
I'd like you to bring me some food.
Just name it, sir.
Please send up a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
Regrettably, we're currently out of filet mignon
May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
Sure, I love porterhouse, too.
Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries.
Okay, no strawberries tonight
The items will be charged to your amenities account.
Go right ahead.
Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible.
I need something to eat, please.
Tell me what you're hungry for.
I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
Unfortunately, we're out of filet mignon at the moment
May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too.
Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Just the champagne will be fine, thank you.
You'll see this charge on your amenities account.
That's fine.
It won't be long until your food is delivered
I know you'll enjoy it.
Can I order something from the kitchen?
Just tell me what you'd like, please.
A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit the spot.
I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon
May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!
Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne
Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries
That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all charged to your amenities account.
Not a problem.
Please call if you have any other requests
Your food will be delivered promptly
I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan.
Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?
My date's very sophisticated, so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best.
May I suggest our own hotel restaurant
It got three stars in the latest restaurant review.
No, thank you, I want to go out on the town
What other ideas do you have?
There's always Gramercy Tavern
They have live jazz
The food is delicious, but very expensive.
That sounds like a good place to take a date
Can you make a reservation for me?
As you wish, sir
You'll have a wonderful time there.
Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?
Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?
My date is quite sophisticated
She would expect nothing less than the best.
Well, how about our own hotel restaurant
It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating.
That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in
Something else, maybe?
Well, how about Gramercy Tavern
It's a very popular tourist spot, with great food and music.
That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?
Of course, sir
You've made a good choice.
So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind
I'm taking a date to a restaurant.
I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?
She strikes me as being very sophisticated
Only the best will do for her.
Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant
It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.
I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight
How about another restaurant?
The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated
It has great food and live jazz, but it's not cheap.
Yes, that sounds like a winner
Would you please call them to reserve a table?
I'm already dialing, sir.
I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good one?
But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?
She deserves nothing but the best, of course.
In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant
The chef, the food, and the service are outstanding.
I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant
Do you have another one in mind?
You can always go to Gramercy Tavern
It's quite popular, despite its expensive entrees
Great food and lots of patrons
What more could I want
Please reserve a table for me.
Yes, sir
You're going to have a great time.
I'm taking my date to a restaurant
Could you tell me about one or two good ones?
My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?
She will want an excellent restaurant, of course.
You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris
The service and food are world-class.
I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here
Do you know of another good restaurant?
You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern
It's famous for its food, service, and live jazz.
I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?
At once, sir
You'll love this place, I assure you.
Well, I've got a date
Now I need to find a restaurant
Can you help me
No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady?
Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!
Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here
This hotel has a three-star restaurant.
I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town
Do you have another suggestion?
Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant
Plus, they have live jazz.
Gramercy Tavern
I think I've heard of that before
Call to get us a table, okay?
Right away, sir
She will be impressed with your local knowledge
The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice.
Of course
I'd be more than happy to help
I am, after all, the hotel's concierge.
Concierge
What exactly is that?
We advise you on where to visit, eat, or shop during your stay here in New York.
Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?
The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin.
I saw the Statue of Liberty on my last visit here
Can you recommend somewhere else?
Hmm
What type of interests do you have?
In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running.
Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
No, but I've heard a lot about both.
Well, Central Park is wonderful for running
Afterwards, you should head to the Museum to enjoy the art.
Great! That sounds like a plan
Thanks a lot.
I'm sure you'll have a good time there.
I was told to see you about going sightseeing.
It's my pleasure
I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service.
Concierge
Could you explain that to me?
We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop.
Very good
So where shall I begin my sightseeing?
I would suggest the Statue of Liberty.
Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty
What about another site?
Let me see
What do you like to do in your spare time?
I really like to run
And I like art.
Well, there you go! Have you ever visited either Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
No, but I've been meaning to.
Well, Central Park is fantastic for running
Then you can go to the Museum to look at the beautiful art.
That sounds like a great plan
I'll do that.
Enjoy your run and your visit!
I need some sightseeing advice.
That's what I'm here for, sir
Every good hotel has a concierge like me.
I don't travel a lot
What exactly is a concierge?
A concierge helps visitors like you find great places to visit, shop, and eat.
That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?
I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty.
You know, I've already been there
Can you suggest another place?
Maybe
Tell me what you like to do in your spare time.
When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums.
Well, have you ever been to either Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
No, but I sure would like to.
Central Park is great for just about everything outdoors
Then you can visit the Museum of Modern Art.
Both places sound great
I'll try to do that today.
Enjoy the views at both places.
I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first.
I'm only too happy to help
Tourists should always check with their concierge first.
Concierge
I'm not familiar with that word.
A concierge directs visitors to the city's great tourist, shopping, and eating places.
That sounds great
Now, is there any place that I should hit first?
Well, if you're like most people, you'll want to go to the Statue of Liberty.
I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else.
Sure! Tell me about your interests.
I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters.
You'll get along fabulously at Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either?
No, I just haven't had the opportunity.
You'll love Central Park for running
Later on, you can go to the Museum of Modern Art.
Thank you
That's what I'll do.
This might be the best day of your visit.
I need some sightseeing advice
I was told to come to see you.
As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir.
Concierge
Are we speaking English here?
A concierge helps you find all the great places for visiting, shopping, and eating.
What would you suggest that I visit first?
How about starting at the Statue of Liberty
Many people like to begin there.
The last time I was here, I visited the Statue
So do you have another place in mind?
I think so
Tell me what interests you.
I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running.
Then you must go to Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either one?
No
I haven't had a chance to go to either of them.
Both places are usually crowded with natives and tourists
You'll love the Park and the Museum.
Thank you
That's great advice.
This might be the best day of your visit.
Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing
Your concierge, sir, is the right person to ask when you need sightseeing advice.
What in the world is a concierge?
We direct visitors to all the great tourist, shopping, and eating spots in the city.
Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?
Definitely the Statue of Liberty
I think that that is everyone's favorite first stop
Actually, I've already been there twice
Do you have another suggestion?
I think I can come up with something
How do you spend your spare time?
I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums.
Well, the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park were made for you! Have you gone to either one?
No, although I've heard great things about both of them.
You don't want to miss either place
Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art are big and beautiful.
Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here.
This is a day you're going to remember for a long time
I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.
What time do you want the call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
We can certainly do that
Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at 7:15.
Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?
I can certainly do that
Is there anything else?
I can't think of anything
If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again.
Okay
Good night, sir.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.
Of course
When would you like the call?
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
No problem
We'll give you both calls.
Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.
No problem
Anything else, sir?
Not at the moment, thank you.
Let me know if you do need anything.
Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?
Certainly
What time would you like us to call you?
I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Not a problem
We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.
On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 7:15.
Said, and done
Will there be anything else?
No, that gets it for now, thank you.
Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.
Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.
Not a problem
What time shall we call you?
I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
It'll be our pleasure
We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.
Oops, cancel that
Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?
No sooner said than done
Can I help you with anything else?
No, that's about it for now.
Okay, sir
Have a pleasant evening.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow.
What time would you like your wake-up call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
That is no problem at all, of course
You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.
Then again, I think 7:15 is too early
Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.
So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30
Do you have any other requests?
Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.
Okay, sir
Sleep well.
I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.
Of course
We can give you a call anytime you like.
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Your wish is our command
Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15
Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it
Change it to 7:30.
The second call is now changed to 7:30
Is there anything else we can help you with?
Nothing that I can think of right now
If something comes up, though, I'll call you.
We're here all night long if you need anything

I have no problem with that.
Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Definitely nonsmoking
I can't handle that smell.
Nonsmoking

It's great to be home!
Did you have a nice trip?
It had its surprises, but when all was said and done, it was a good trip.
What was your favorite part?
I loved our full moon beach party.
What were the people like
Were they friendly?
The people were basically quite friendly.
Did you bring me anything?
I brought you a lovely souvenir that I will be giving you for your birthday next week.
I can't wait until I get to be the one to go on vacation.
I love traveling, but I love coming home, too!
Did you enjoy your vacation?
It had its ups and downs, but I really enjoyed it.
What did you like the best?
I absolutely enjoyed the kayak trip we took to an outlying island.
Did you enjoy the people there
Did they like you?
Most of the people seemed happy that we were there, but some of them really resented visitors.
What did you bring back for me?
I did get you something, and I will give to you as soon as I unpack.
Next time, I am going to save up my money and go with you.
How nice it is to be home again with all of my family!
Did your journey turn out as well as you had hoped it would?
All trips have good and bad points, but this one had mostly good ones.
Did you have something you enjoyed the most?
My favorite thing was the amazing food.
Were the people receptive to having visitors?
You could tell that some people did not have a favorable view of Americans.
Did you get me a souvenir?
Of course I brought you something!
Next time I am going to be the one to go away, and you can stay home and feed the dog
Is this where I catch the Super Shuttle?
Yes, this is where you catch the Super Shuttle
Where are you headed?
I am headed home to Pasadena.
You can tell where each van is headed by the name on the front of the van
I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.
Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena?
I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a lot of stops?
Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him
He needs to be upfront with you about the number of stops he will be making.
Do I need to have exact change?
You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills.
They told me inside that I should catch the Super Shuttle here.
You are in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle
What is your destination?
I am trying to get to my home in Pasadena.
Look at the sign on the front of the van to tell where each van is headed
My van is going to Glendale, but yours will be along in minute.
How much does a trip to Pasadena cost?
If I remember correctly, that trip costs sixty dollars.
I am hoping that this shuttle goes straight to my city without making a bunch of stops.
Always ask the driver how many stops he plans to make before you pay him.
If I have large bills, should I break them while I am waiting?
It is better if you have cash close to the amount of the fare
There is an ATM machine right over there.
Am I in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle?
This is the Super Shuttle stop
Where are you trying to get to?
My final destination is my home in Pasadena.
The destination of each van is always written across the top
I have Glendale written on mine, but your van will be here shortly.
What is the price of a shuttle trip to Pasadena?
The trip to Pasadena costs sixty dollars.
I need to know if this shuttle is going to make a lot of stops or go straight to Pasadena.
If you find out the driver will be making too many stops on the way, you may wish to wait for a more direct shuttle.
What should I pay the driver with?
There is an ATM machine over by that wall
It is best if you have bills close to the amount that you will owe.

Being Cautious in a Big City


Is there anything special I need to think about as I tour this city?
You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country
Things are a little more desperate here than you are used to.
What do I need to look for?
Be particularly vigilant anytime you are in a crowded place with other tourists
Pickpockets know that tourists aren't paying all that much attention.
I have seen many children on the street begging, so what do I do about them?
It is best not to give money to children or other beggars on the street, as they can swarm you
You can give money to a local charity.
Should I be concerned about what I eat or drink?
Do not drink any water that isn't bottled
Avoid street vendor food.
How about being out on the street at night?
I would take a cab to your destination at night
Don't walk down the street alone.
This city is much larger than the one I live in, and I wonder if there is anything special that I need to keep in mind.
Crime can happen anywhere, but it is a little worse here because of the poverty.
Should I be vigilant about anything in particular?
The train stations, airports, and tourist sites are favorite spots for pickpockets.
When I see children on the street begging, what amount should I give them?
I wouldn't suggest giving money to them
Most of them are put out there by adults who then take their money.
Can I eat or drink anything I want to?
Do not use tap water at all, not even to brush your teeth
Only eat fruit that has been peeled.
Can I walk around and see the sights at night?
I would be sure to travel in a group at night
Stay in well-lit areas.
Do I need to take any special safety precautions in this city?
This is a very large city with a lot of crowds to work your way through
Keep in mind that poverty makes people a little more desperate.
What should I watch out for?
You have to pay special attention at train stations, airports, and tourist sites
They are known for having a lot of pickpockets.
There are so many children begging on the street that I don't know which ones to give money to.
It is a natural instinct to want to give money to those children, but it is better to give money to one of the local charities or schools.
Are the local food and drink safe?
Avoid eating food prepared by street vendors
Use only bottled water.
How safe is it to be out at night?
You should always travel with others at night and stick to well-lit areas.

Losing the Wallet and Passport


I can't find my purse!
What was in your purse?
It contained my wallet and passport.
How much money was in your wallet?
There was about $200 in my wallet, and I had some traveler's checks in there, too.
We can call American Express to deal with the traveler's checks
How about credit cards?
I had a MasterCard and a Visa Card.
We can look at the back of my cards to get the emergency phone numbers.
Where do I report that my passport is missing?
We need to take a cab to the embassy to report that right away
They will help us.

Do you think you need to go to a doctor?
I think that we should maybe check into how to find a doctor in this country.
I don't know where to begin looking for a doctor here.

I have an American Express card
I heard that their travel services are quite good.
That sounds like a great idea!
Do you have travel insurance?
Yes, I bought travel health insurance.
I am going to call down to the office right now and see what they can do for us.
I haven't felt well since we ate dinner at that restaurant with the fish on the menu.
Should I look into finding a doctor for you?
I feel bad enough that I am thinking about how we could find a doctor.
How does someone find a physician in this country?

Shopping for Souvenirs


I want to look at the souvenirs over at the souvenir stand.
What do you need to buy?
I usually buy myself some jewelry or some clothing.
I always buy a lot of things for my family
How about you?
Yes, they practically swarm me when I get home!
What are some of their favorite gifts?
The teenagers like me to bring them tee shirts that you can't get anywhere else.
This stuff is pretty expensive, isn't it?
Souvenirs cost a lot for what they are, but we can shop around for better prices.
Let's go across the street and see what they have over there.
Let's stop and look at the souvenirs at the souvenir stand.
What types of souvenirs were you looking for?
When I travel, I usually like to bring back a special necklace or clothing.
I end up buying a lot of stuff for the kids in my family

My family loves for me to take trips so they can get the goodies I bring them.
What types of things do they like?
The little kids like little trinkets, like those little shell animals over there.
I feel like this stuff is kind of overpriced.
Some souvenir stands charge more than others, so it pays to shop around.
Why don't we try checking prices a little farther away from the tourist section?
We need to stop so I can shop for some souvenirs at the souvenir stand.

Making Alternate Plans


I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain!
Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun
What would you like to do instead?
I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch, and maybe see a movie.
Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and still stay dry.
What else could we do in bad weather?
You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses and buildings.
That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.
There is an old English pub next door
Maybe when we finish with the haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.
What a great idea!
If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for supper.
This rain sort of blows our chances of going rollerblading!
No, I don't think that we will be able to do what we planned to do
What can we do for fun today?
There is a large indoor mall just down the street with an incredible ice rink we could check out.
We could stay inside and dry, and still get out of this hotel room for a while.
I am trying to think of something else that we could do in bad weather.
We could sign up for that double-decker bus tour of haunted houses.
The rainy day would only add to the haunted house atmosphere.
I think that when we are done with our haunted house touring, we should pop into the English pub next door for a beer.
I could go for that!
I hope that we can get some nice hot food for dinner at the pub.
I think that rollerblading today is kind of not happening in this rainstorm.
We definitely need to come up with a different plan to amuse ourselves
What do you think would be fun?
There is a large indoor mall hooked onto the Modern Art Museum just down the street.
That would allow us to stay dry and still get a feel for the local culture.
I wonder what the locals do in bad weather.
There is a sign for a double-decker tour of haunted houses in the lobby.
Haunted houses would be a perfect outing for a rainy day!
I think we should wrap up our rainy haunted house day with some ale at the English pub down the street.
I think that rainy days and pubs go together!
Usually pubs have some pretty good cold-weather food
Maybe we can have dinner there.

20
Sightseeing

At the end of the day, I would love to take in the sunset at the restaurant by the park.

It's so hard to choose where to go first on our sightseeing trip!
We could think of what would make a good morning activity versus an evening activity.
I really wanted to make sure that I got a chance to go to the local beach.
I think that that would be a fun beginning to our day
We could walk around there.
I heard that the Natural History Museum is pretty close to the beach.
I heard the same thing
We might as well go there since we are just down the street.
What would be a good place to go to in the afternoon?
The local amusement park is supposed to be wonderful.
The restaurant on the edge of the park would be a great place to watch the sun go down.
That sounds like a perfect sightseeing day to me.
There are so many places to go on our sightseeing trip that I am having trouble narrowing it down.
Let's figure out what to do before lunch and later figure out what to do in the afternoon.
I heard that the local beach is a place that can't be missed.
That would be a relaxing way to begin our morning
It would be good to get out in the sun.
The Natural History Museum is close by, isn't it?
That museum is supposed to be fantastic!
Do you have any suggestions as to where we could go in the afternoon?
We could check out the local amusement park.
We could eat dinner and watch the sun go down at that restaurant by the park.
That could really end up being a great day!

Talking to a Seatmate


That rain is really coming down out there!
Yes, it's kind of crazy weather outside.
I get kind of nervous flying in this kind of weather.
I don't think anyone feels all that comfortable flying in a storm.
Do you think it will be this bad the whole trip?
On the weather channel, this storm looked to be a big one
It will probably be with us for a while.
I worry about too much ice on the wings.
I have to believe that our pilot knows what he is doing and we'll be okay.
When do you think the pilot will turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign?
He'll turn it off as soon as he knows that we are through the turbulence.
Do you think that we are going to crash?
Maybe
You just never know.
It sure is windy out there!
It definitely is not the perfect day to fly, is it?
I am scared of flying to begin with, but bad weather makes it a little worse.
Anyone who actually enjoys flying in bad weather is out of their mind.
Will the whole flight be this bad?
I think that it will probably let up once we get out of here
Let's cross our fingers!
What if we hit a flock of birds?
Plane crashes are very rare
We'll be fine.
Do you think that the pilot will ever turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign?
The pilot needs to make sure that there is no more turbulence before he lets us get up.
Do you think that we are going to die?
Can I buy you an alcoholic beverage?
I can't believe how bad the weather is today!
Yes, according to the weather report, we will be flying through a pretty nasty storm.

How long do you think this will last?
Usually the pilot can get enough altitude to get above it
I hope that happens this time!
What if one of the engines stops working?
I trust that the airline wouldn't let us take off without feeling that all was okay.
How much longer do you think that the pilot will leave the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign on?
When we are past the turbulence, I am sure that the pilot will shut the light off.
Do you think we are headed for an air disaster?
Would you like a pillow and blanket so you can take a nap?

Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
This is my first time buying health insurance.
You have a choice of HMO or PPO
Do you understand the difference?
I am not sure what those are.
Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?
By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?
We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.

Where to Buy a Used Car


 
Where is the best place to buy a used car?
I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but actually you have many options.
Where else could I look for a car?
You could look on the Internet
Craigslist is best, as most of the cars listed there are sold locally.
What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are for sale?
The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot.
Where is CarMax?
There are many of them
You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for the one closest to you.
How about the listings on the college bulletin board?
Actually, that is not a bad way to go, especially near the end of a semester as students are moving away.
 
Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?
There are a lot of different ways to go
I bought my last one from an advertisement in the paper.
What are my other options for looking for a used car?
Internet listings are good
Craigslist is pretty good because most of the cars are sold locally.
I think that I might actually like to see many used cars together so I can compare them.
The biggest used car lot is CarMax
I would check that place out.
How can I find out where CarMax is?
Look in the phone book or on the Internet for the one closest to you
There are a lot of them.
Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?
The school bulletin board can have some great deals, as many students sell their cars before they return home or as they get better paying jobs.
 
Where did you buy your last used car?
I found my last one in an advertisement in the newspaper, but there are a lot of other places to look for used cars.
Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?
My friend bought his used car off of Craigslist
It works out better than eBay because the cars listed are located close by.
Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?
Go to CarMax if you want to see the largest selection of used cars in one place.
I don't know where CarMax is.
CarMax has many car lots in many cities
For the one closest to you, check out the Internet or phone book.
Have you ever known anyone who bought a car off a listing on the university bulletin board?
You can get a good deal there
Especially at the end of the year, when students are selling things and returning home.

Making an Appointment with the DMV


 
I need to go to the DMV and don't know how to make an appointment with them.
First of all you need to figure out if you really need to be there in person
Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club or at the DMV website.
If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?
You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website.
What if I just show up there?
If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you.
Is the DMV open on Saturdays?
Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club!
Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!
 
How can I make an appointment at the DMV?
You could check the DMV website or see if the Automobile Club could help you
Many things can be taken care of without actually going in to the DMV in person.
How do I make an appointment if I have to actually go in?
You have two choices
You can call them at the number listed on their website or you can contact them online.
Can I just walk in and get help?
Without an appointment, you will be waiting for many hours
I would not advise it.
Can I take care of this on a Saturday?
Unfortunately, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
It probably would be easier for me to join the Automobile Club.
The Automobile Club has many benefits, and taking care of your DMV transactions is one of the best benefits.
 
Can you help me figure out how to make an appointment with the DMV?
I would try to avoid going in to the DMV in person
If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they oftentimes can take care of things for you or you can try the DMV website.
It would be nice not to have to go in but if I have to, how do I make an appointment?
The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone.
What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?
That is not a good way to go
You could be left waiting for many hours and there is no guarantee that they will see you at all!
What about going to the DMV on Saturday?
For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore.
I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion.
You should check out the Automobile Club
I think you would enjoy being a member.

Negotiating a Price with a Student


 
This car is exactly what I want!
I am glad that you like it
I've had good experiences with this car.
So, how much do you want for the car?
Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars.
Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car.
I might be able to come down a little on the price.
How about selling the car for four thousand?
No, that's way less than I could accept
However, I could accept forty-five hundred.
That sounds fair to me.
It's a deal then
Thank you!
 
I really love this car!
Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it.
How much are you willing to take for the car?
As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars.
Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?
You seem like a nice person
Maybe I could lower the price a bit.
Would you sell it to me for four thousand?
I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred.
I'll take it then!
Perfect! That works for both of us.
 
I am definitely interested in buying this car.
Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car.
What is the price for this car?
The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars.
I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit.
You know I just got a good deal on my new car
I think I can afford to knock a little off of this car.
I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price.
I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred.
That would work well for me.
It's done then
I've enjoyed doing business with you.

Negotiating a Price with a Dealer


 
How much does this car cost?
Well, come on in and we'll sit down and discuss that right now
How much do you want to pay?
I really was just wondering what the price is.
Well, figuring in tax, license, dealer prep, and registration, I can let this car go for fifteen thousand dollars.
I was thinking a little lower than that.
Whoa! Let's keep talking here
I am sure we can work something out
What price are you thinking is fair?
I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.
You know, you look like you are a sweet kid
I'll give it to you for fourteen thousand dollars.
That would be a good price if the car was in great shape, but it is registered as having been in an accident.
OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer.
 
If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?
Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now.
Can't you just tell me what it costs?
You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car
With tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand dollars.
Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk then.
I am sure that we can work something out
What price were you thinking would be a good deal for you?
Thirteen thousand would be more like it.
Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price
For that I am practically giving it away.
Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident.
Yes, I see your point
Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.
 
How much money for this car?
Yes, that car is beautiful, isn't it
Come on inside and we'll discuss the price.
I just want to know the price.
Fifteen thousand out the door! What a deal! That will, of course, include tax, license, registration, and dealer prep.
I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later.
Oh, you look like a smart person
What price would be fair to you?
I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car.
I can see that you are a smart buyer
Fourteen thousand is my best price.
If the car hadn't been in an accident, that would be a good price, but it has a few minor problems.
Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.

Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road.
I want to take the car up to freeway speed.
Take a left at the next signal to enter the freeway
Just keep it under the speed limit!
This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway.
You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you.

11
Title Transfer


 
Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?
Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website.
Basically, what will I need to do?
Both buyer and seller need to transfer the ownership by filling out a Change of Ownership form and signing over the Certificate of Title, which will be either pink or rainbow
Will I have to pay any fees?
All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
How much will it cost to transfer the title?
The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees
They will figure it out for you.
Do I need a Smog Certificate?
No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975.
Where do I take my forms?
You can take them to the DMV
You have ten days to complete the process.
 
I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car.
If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website.
What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?
The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign
They also both need to fill out the Change of Ownership form.
Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?
The buyer must pay all of the fees.
Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?
The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork.
What about a Smog Certificate?
No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine.
Where can I turn in my forms?
If you are a member of the Automobile Club, you can turn in your forms to them.
 
Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?
You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful.
Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?
When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred.
Are there any fees involved?
As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees.
How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?
The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you.
Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?
No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one.
Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?
Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV.

How to Pay for the Used Car


 
I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing it.
I can help you
Do you have a down payment?
Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.
Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car.
I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
What is the best choice for financing?
It depends
The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car
Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance
Good luck!
 
Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?
I would love to help you with what I know
I am assuming that you have a down payment.
Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment.
That will work
A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a down payment.
I am not sure who will loan money to me.
You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car dealer who sold you the car
You might also try family and friends.
Who offers the best interest rate?
A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer will almost always give you some type of loan.
Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?
Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip
You will have a few days to produce proof of insurance
Enjoy your new car!
 
I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am thinking of buying.
I would be happy to help you
Have you saved up a down payment?
I will be getting money from selling my old car.
You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you the rest of the money that you need
Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?
Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a car lot, they might use the dealer finance company.
What is the best place to get financing?
The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are your only choice if you are just starting out.
Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?
Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink slip
You can then work on getting insured
Enjoy your new car!

Detecting a Problem with the Car


 
I was thinking about buying this used car, and was wondering if you would take a look at it for me to see if it has any problems.
Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look.
I just wasn't sure what to look for.
The first thing you do is look for any signs of wear both inside and out
We will also look at the body for signs of major repair.
Someone told me that I could go online and see if the car is listed as having been in a major accident.
Yes, that's right
Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under the hood to look at the hoses and belts.
Should we take the car for a drive?
Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn signals, lights, and seats all work properly.
As I am driving what should I be checking?
You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car has good alignment and acceleration.
Thanks for your help.
You are welcome
Enjoy driving your car!
 
Could you take a few minutes and see if there are any problems with this used car that I am thinking of buying?
I am happy to help
Just pull up and we'll give it a good look.
I don't know much about cars.
We need to look inside and outside for signs of an accident or major damage
Also, we need to look for wear on the tires.
If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a major accident.
Yes, you can check the history of the car online
Next, we need to turn on the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses.
Will you take a drive with me to check handling?
A test drive would be good
But first let's make sure that the turn signals, radio, lights, and seats work properly.
On a test drive, what should I look for?
We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling.
I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for.
My pleasure
This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you.
 
I want to buy this used car, but I need help figuring out if there are any problems with it.
I can help you with that
Drive the car over by the garage and we'll check it out.
I know some things to look for, but I know there are other special things to look for.
Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been repaired and also check tire wear.
If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded online.
Right
All major accidents should have been recorded
Next start the car up, pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses.
I would like for you to take a test drive with me.
We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn signals, and all of the lights work properly.
As we drive, what am I checking for?
You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop.
I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the help.
This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems
Enjoy it!

Declining to Buy the Car


 
Thank you for letting me test drive the car.
So do you think that you would like to purchase this car?

Maybe I can fix something for you.
It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time.
I have some other cars you might want to look at.

Have a good day.
 
I appreciate you letting me take the car out for a spin.
Why don't you come over here and we can work out the details of the purchase?
I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time.
It's a great deal
Let's talk price
Maybe you'll change your mind.
This is only the first car that I've looked at.
Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?
It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money.
I really think that you should reconsider.
Thank you again for your time.
Thank you for stopping by
Good luck in your search for a car.
 
I enjoyed taking the car out for a test drive.
Isn't that a great car
Let's work out the details of purchase.
I will not be purchasing the car today.
Why don't you take a second look at that car
You'll see that it is as good a deal as you are going to get.
I need to compare this car to others to make an informed choice.
You said on the phone that this is the kind of car you wanted
What has changed your mind?
I just really need to make sure that I get the best car for my money.
You know, you can look around but I just don't think that you are going to get a better deal for your money.
I will continue looking around for cars and will get back to you if I change my mind.
OK, then
Have a good day.

That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.

A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.
It's good that you took care of that
Have you agreed upon a price with the seller?
Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that.

I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.

Let's go take care of that right now
I really want to see your new car!

What should I think about in choosing services?
There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.

Actually, it could have been better.

Little Tips for Bad Service


Do you want some dessert?
No thanks
We just need our check
Have you seen the waitress?
Where is our waitress anyway?
Yes, the service hasn't been the best
Is that our waitress over there?
I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.
Good idea
Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
So the bill is $36.00.
How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.
I agree, but we don't really know the whole story
There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.
Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.
I agree
We will leave $3.60 for the tip.
Would you like some more coffee?
No thanks
I'm full
We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
Good luck finding the waitress!
The service this evening has kind of sucked
Is that our server over there?
I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.
Good
I'll just stay here until you get back.
So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.
How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?
I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.
I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.
I think that we should leave 10%.
$3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.
Would you like to order anything else?
No, I'm good
All we need now is our check.
Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?
I think that is our waitress over by the bar
Boy, the service has not been good this evening.
She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.
Good
Just bring it back and we'll total it together.
Our total for dinner is $36.00.
What do you think would be the right amount to tip?
I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.
I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.
I believe that 10% is just about right.
I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.

12
Good Tips for Good Service


Do you want some dessert?
No thanks
We just need our check
Have you seen the waitress?
Here comes our waitress with our check.
The service here has been really great, don't you think?
Yes, the service was quite good.
So, let's look at the check
The total is $36.00.
How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service
I am thinking that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.
I agree that 20 percent would be just about right.
OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20
Add it to the $36.00 and the total is $43.20.
Yes, what a nice dinner that was!
We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.
Would you like some more coffee?
No thanks
I'm full
We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
The waitress is bringing the bill right now.
This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?
Yes, this waitress did a great job.
OK, let's see what the damage is
The total for our meal is $36.00.
What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?
Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job
What do you think about 20 percent this time?
Yes, 20 percent would be perfect.
Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00
The total will be $43.20.
Yes, that was one fantastic meal!
I agree
Maybe we can come back again next week.
Would you like to order anything else?
No, I'm good
All we need now is our check.
The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak.
I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really exceptional.
Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience.
Let's take a look at our bill
The total price for our dinner is $36.00.
How much money should we leave for a tip?
I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us
What do you think about tipping her 20 percent?
She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip.
So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be $43.20.
Yes, what a wonderful meal!
It absolutely was a great meal
We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.

Going to an Antique Shop


I want to find an old music box.
We have a great selection
What decade are you looking for?
Do you have anything made in the 1920s?
We have six.
Do any of them have dancing figures?
Actually, two of them have dancing figures.
That's fantastic
I think I like this one.
A good choice
I prefer that one myself.
Is there any warranty with this?
Oh, no, I'm afraid not
These things are just too old to guarantee anything.
I understand.
Even if they break down, they're still works of art.
Excuse me
I'm looking for an old music box.
Any particular decade?
Something made in the 20s would be nice.
We had seven, but we sold one this morning.
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?
You're in luck
Two of them have dancing figures.
These are great
I think I'll take this one.
Yes, that one is very nice.
Does this come with a warranty?
I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances.
That doesn't surprise me.
Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible.
Pardon me
I need an old music box.

Two of the boxes have them.
I love the dancing figures
I'll take this music box.

I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?
No
But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.
I was just hoping.
It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
I want to purchase an old music box.
We have a good variety
What decade would you like?
I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s.
There are six on this table.
I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.
Many people like the dancing figures
Two of our boxes have the figures.
It's so hard to choose
I think I'll take this one.
That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.
Does a warranty come with this music box?
I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.
I just thought I would ask.
When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.
I'm searching for an old music box.
You came to the right place
Any particular decade?
If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice.
We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.
Would any of them have dancing figures?
Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.
They're both so beautiful
Let me have this one, I think.
That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?
One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box?
Oh, no
Everything we sell here is ‘as is.'
I guess I was asking for too much.
If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.

It's the right size, but it weighs too much.
Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan?
It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking.
Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle.
My family's going to love this one
I'll take it.
I'm so happy that you found what you wanted
Do you want to use a credit card?
Sure
Wait, wait
Does a lid come with this pan?
Oh, I'm sorry
Here's the lid
Yes, it comes with the pan.
I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen.
What size pan were you thinking of?
I've already got a small pan
I need a big one.
Well, this one might work for you.
No, that's way too heavy a pan for me.
Here, lift this aluminum pan
It's the same size.
Yes, it's very lightweight
But I don't want this aluminum handle.
Here's a similar aluminum pan
But it has a heat-resistant handle.
This feels very nice
It's perfect
I'll take it.
I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later

Ads can be very tricky.
I don't know when I'll ever learn.
No problem
I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale
I'll be right back.

My house is too far, and I'm really hungry.
It sounds as if you're going to continue starving.
 
I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito.
I'm a little short
I don't have enough for you.
I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today.
I really don't have enough money.
My stomach feels so empty.
Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money
I'm hungry too.
I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then.
Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.
That's not nice
You can always go home and make something to eat.
I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here.
Sorry
That's not my fault.

My plans aren't until later, so I'll clean it before I go.
 
Have you started cleaning up your room yet?
I haven't gotten started on my room yet.
When exactly do you plan on cleaning it?
I have every intention of cleaning my room later.
I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier.
I already told you that I'm going to do it.
Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything.
I'll remember to do that.
Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room.
I'll clean my room before I leave.

Talking with Angry Parent


 
Do you realize what time it is?
I'm sorry, I lost track of time.
Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse?
Not at all--that is what really happened.
How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late?
Yes, I know
I must've forgot.
That's beside the point, you still should have called.
You're right
I'm sorry.
Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone.
You're really going to kick me out?
Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules.
Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore.
 
Do you have any idea what time it is?
My bad
I didn't realize that it was so late.
Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness?
Of course not
I really did lose track of time.
Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?
Yeah, you did
I just forgot to call.
It doesn't matter, you should have called and let me know.
That's true
My bad for not calling.
If you do this again, don't even bother coming home.
You're going to kick me out over this?
Exactly, maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules.
Well, if I'm not living here anymore, then I won't have to listen to your rules.
 
Do you know how late it is?
My fault
I didn't realize what time it was.
I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook.
Not really
I'm telling the truth.
Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?
This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.
Regardless, all you had to do was give a call.
I know
I should've called.
Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.
You want to throw me out over this?
That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.
That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.

Stopping the Relationship


Hi Kara, it's Mike here.
Hi Mike, how are you doing?
I'm doing well, and you?
Everything is going great
Kara, would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday?
Mike, I had a good time too, but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast, so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now.
Well, we could just go out as friends.
Right now, I think I need to really focus on matters at home, but thanks for a nice evening.
Hi Kara, this is Mike
Hello Mike
How are things going for you?
Great, how are you?
Fine
Everything is just fine.
Kara, I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend.
Mike, I enjoyed your company, but I am getting ready to graduate soon
I really need to focus on my studies.
Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done.
It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done, but thank you for a lovely dinner.
Hello, this is Mike, Kara.
Mike! Good to hear from you
How are you?
Everything is fine, and how are you?
Things are going well with me.
Kara, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday.
Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again
I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.
Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.
I can't really deal with any distractions right now, but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together.

Rejecting an Invitation


Joe, how are you doing?
I am great! How about you, Mary
How are you?
I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe.
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.
OK
What about going to the movies on Friday night?
What were you planning on seeing?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.
How about “The Secret Life of Bees”?
That's a chick flick!
Hi Joe, how are you doing today?
Things are going good today
How have you been doing, Mary?
Things are going well for me, Joe.
Want to go see a movie tonight?
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night, instead?
What movie did you want to see?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer.
I was thinking that I would like to see “The Secret Life of Bees.”
Oh great! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to!
Hey Joe, how have you been?
I am doing well
How about you, Mary?
I am doing OK, Joe
There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see
Want to go with me?
I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her.
I could go to the movies on Friday night instead
Would that be better?
Did you have a certain movie in mind?
I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice.
I kind of wanted to see “The Secret Life of Bees.”
Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie!

An Argument


John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year.
I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?
You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us!
Really
Who made that rule up?
With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here.
That works for me!
John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year.
I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.
You can't be serious!
Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation
I am sorry that bothers you.
After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.
Says who
I don't think that is necessarily the case.
You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to you at all!
Whatever you say!
Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year, John.
I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska.
Are you kidding me?
You know what
You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark
What's the problem?
We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together.
I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before
Any more rules that you would like to tell me about?
Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move in with him as well!
I am really looking forward to getting away from you
Far away from you!

What time will you be at my house?
Nine would be good, don't you think?
Nine is good

Dating Discussion


Do you enjoy going on dates?
Yes
I find dates to be a lot of fun.
What's so fun about them?
They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better.
So you always have fun on dates?
Not always
I don't always like the person I'm on the date with.
Why not?
My date may not be my type.
So then why would you ask them out in the first place?
I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type.
Sounds like a huge waste of time to me.
Now that I think about it, it really is sometimes.
Do you like dating?
It's really a lot of fun.
What makes it so much fun?
It makes it easier to get to know somebody.
Are dates always fun to you?
Sometimes I may not like the person I'm having a date with.
Why is that?
The other person isn't always my type.
Why would you bother going out with them then?
I didn't know that they weren't my type until after I got to know them better.
It seems to me that you're wasting your time.
You are absolutely correct, sometimes it is a waste.
Are dates fun for you?
I enjoy dating a lot.
Why are they so fun for you?
Dates allow me to meet new people.
Your dates are always fun?
Well, I don't always like who I'm dating; so not always.
How come?
The person I am dating may not be my type.
How come you asked them out if they weren't your type?
You don't always know what type of person you go on a date with until you know them well enough.
Dating sounds pointless.
Now that you mention it, sometimes you're right.

Well, to each his own.
You are absolutely right.
Their wedding was just exquisite.
I know
Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that.
What do you think their budget was?
It must have cost them a pretty penny.
Would you like to have a big wedding like they did?
No
I think I would prefer a smaller wedding.
I want a big wedding.
How come?
I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it.
Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable.
Whatever floats your boat.
That is correct.
Their wedding was so beautiful.
I agree completely
I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?
I think it cost them a lot of money.
Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?
I don't think so
I want to have a smaller wedding.
Not me.
Why do you want a bigger wedding?
I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember.
You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it.
Whatever flicks your Bic.
That is true.

Hi Julie, how are things going?
Everything is great, Tad
How are you?
I'm doing really well.
Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now
Want to walk over and check out the food table?
Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?
That is Mary
I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.
I thought that he was with Malia.
Oh, that relationship is history
Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday.
I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!
Actually, he was OK with it
They hadn't been getting along too well.
Hi Julie, how are you?
Things are going good, Tad
How about you?
Things have been going well for me.
That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see what's up.
Julie, do you know who that woman talking to Lee is?
I think that her name is Mary
I think that she and Lee are moving in together.
Isn't he with Malia?
Malia dumped him
She ran off with a guy she met on vacation.
Lee was probably less than thrilled with that!
He was kind of relieved
They had been having some problems.
Hi Julie, how have things been going for you?
I'm good, Tad
How are things with you?
Things couldn't be better right now.
Boy, that's quite a spread over on the food table! Let's go check out the party food.
Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa?
Someone told me her name is Mary
Supposedly, she and Lee are living together in Lee's apartment.
What about his relationship with Malia?
Malia is no longer in the picture
She moved to Australia to be with a guy she met on vacation.
How did Lee feel about that happening?
He took it pretty well
I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a while.

That sounds wonderful
Will there be anyone there that I know?
Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.
Great! I'll look forward to it
We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
